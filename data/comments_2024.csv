1,I love trump&#39;s confidence
2,Horrible Performance by the Biden Administration!!! Biden`s too old / Dementia
3,☻️🌍
4,It would seem Joe has amnesia regarding the THIRTEEN US military members that were blown up in Afghanistan during his disastrous pullout in 2021.
5,"Had to come back to this today, because heard the Stephanopolis interview a few hours ago — Biden didn’t do himself any favors today. Still sounded weak, confused, angry, even a bit vindictive in mentioning Trump. Totally in denial about what the polls are showing (think WSJ has Trump up by 6 %, well beyond margin-of-error). In that respect, he was almost Trumpian, trying to present “alternative facts” that fly in the face of reality."
6,For Hawaii 😢here’s $500.00.  “let me tell you something about me” said biden😮 nevertheless heard nothing since..
7,To say groceries have went up 20% is laughable😂 a lot of stuff I’ve been buying literally has doubled or more since Biden took office…
8,Trump ain’t answer no questions he just arguing these dudes venting not debating 😂
9,Please answer the questions for God sake!! We need to know which each party will offer in change for our nation not which President is the worst every question!!
10,I would rather watch them box it out In the ring
11,Wes 🖐☻️
12,In the first debate biden kept saying like a broken record &quot;heres the deal&quot; and now he kept saying &quot;by the way by the way&quot;
13,Biasa bush tulien ta latihan❤nawi
14,Nawi digu maning pinter kadang pembual kadang dll ❤😂
15,Trump won. He’s bringing the facts for the most part. Joe don’t know wth going on.

21,"I hadn’t watched the full debate till just now. Gotta say I didn’t think Biden did AS bad as everyone is making it out to be. I’m 100% positive he is beyond early stages of dementia or some other cognitive issue but I was expecting far worse. Now that being said, I can only imagine what he’s going to look like in another year or two…<br><br>Trump was basically what I expected. A handful of decent talking points mixed with a mountain of hyperbole."
22,Biden administration destroying the middle class - now we see why - he&#39;s been absent from his body this whole time
23,"Because I am proud of the United States of America and United States of Africa remember forgotten.I help Trump in this campaign .Only the new tradition proned by Mandela isnot good.if Joe is 100years old,he can continue to stay in chief of the Un organisation.But I think that my référence Trump is reelly the best choice."

28,We go with trump...biden is a top failure
29,Trump is much more cognitive.
30,I think the real question is who is really running this country? It cannot be Biden  making decisions due to his cognitive issues . <br> I suspect probably his wife.

68,"On the survey Trump was 43 rd out of 45 from worst to best. Joe has problems with communication but the survey claims he&#39;s actually doing something for the country compared to Trump. Yeah right, replace Obamas spot with Trump, Trumps spot with Biden and Biden&#39;s spot with Obama"

78,We paid into Social Security our whole working lives. No immigrant should get a penny of it or Medicare
79,"I think President Biden shouldn&#39;t have been allowed to engage the debate, a bit of slurred speeches. Isn&#39;t it appropriate for someone to act in his place? Not very easy being an opposition to a prospective and eloquent president like Mr. Trump. I admire the courage of Joe Biden, he stood tall with valid points in my opinion."
80,Benjamin Netanyahu had warnings I&#39;m sure he knew something it&#39;s pretty obvious that what he is upto

90,"What I’m seeing from Joe Biden so far after watching half of this “debate” is him mirroring Trump in the way he speaks lol… and constantly accusing him of being a liar with no real evidence to support how he’s lying…… so far this is a massive L for him. <br>Donald Trump is coming through with a far better argument even though I’m not siding with either of them because I think they’re both imbeciles in their own special way. <br>RIP America, was it nice knowing you ? No, not really but you were definitely something."

122,"Biden looks like the white version of Al Sharptongue. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4940"">1:22:20</a>,"
123,"Wait lol did he just say that in the 4 years he’s been president he’s only created 15,000 new jobs and then a further 800,000 manufacturing jobs 🤦🏼‍♀️🤣 in a country that has a population of roughly 300mil ???? <br>Of course there’s more to be done, you’ve done nothing."

131,"It&#39;s funny they are asking Trump about ending political violence, when he has just been the victim of such on the highest level, as Biden has indicted him just because he is his opponent in this election. Incredible."
132,The more CNN makes it blatantly obvious that they&#39;re hand holding Biden throughout this whole thing and still bidens falling just adds more support for Trump always remember that
133,"YUP,YUP,YUP!!!!;Trump IS Right about all of this stuff except abortion, what woman wants there state to make her medicle decisions that should not be anyones bussiness!!

I mean, let’s pretend for a second that the phenomenon of 3rd world nations emptying their prisons into the US isn’t well documented.. it is, but let’s pretend it’s not.. WHY WOULDN’T THEY DO THAT??? Biden told the world we’d let them in with no vetting. Of course they’re going to dump vast quantities of troubled individuals into our once great nation.

157,Blue for crips red for bloods
158,id id been Biden id have faked a medical emergency and left the debate

192,If Biden was X-MAN his super power would be: no one could understand him nevermind how long he speaks.

209,"OH BIDEN TALKS ABOUT, &quot; CHILD CARE&quot; AS ILL-LEAGALS GET FREE MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY, FOOD DEBIT CARDS, HOUSING, MEDICAL, TRANSPORTATION, MILLIONS, AND ALLOWED TO BUY FIRE ARMS, AND PACKING IN DANGEROUS DRUGS, ETC....."

213,In PA all the new workers are imagrants they where approved for work visa.
214,Q: WOULD ANYONE TRUST BIDEN TO DRIVE A SCHOOL BUS ?
215,This is actually a comedy
216,America&#39;s got a problem
217,Nancy didn&#39;t think trump was that dumb to send the crowd
218,The jar building works trumps if you remember Trump was trying to dig this out and started creating the jobs. All the first stuff that was done when Biden got in was from contracts that Trump did.
219,Exactly the same immigration situation as the UK. Something is definitely going on. It&#39;s literally identical.
220,The didn’t even answer the child care question…
221,trump 2024
222,"Fast forward to the august  conference ..Jill ....&#39;&#39;delegates, your choice is non negotiable and final.Joe remains the candidate and we loose in a landslide and you spend the resyt iof yiour days in folsom , or I am the candidate ...we win with  a landslide  . We keep the WH  , you keep your jobs and I become the most succesful president this counttry  has ever had !  And thank your lucky stars ! &#39;&#39;"
223,"If Biden wins again, the election is 100 per cent rigged. Im pretty sure the last one was to be honest."
224,Joe Biden for President
225,Is there no better candidate apart from Trump and Biden? It will be much better to engage young-minded youths in politics. 30 -60 years of age.
226,I felt like Adam Sandler was was going to take the stage and say. &quot; Welcome to another Saturday Night alive!&quot;
227,"The biggest thing to understand from this is that this is not a Biden issue. It is the entire Democrat party. After all, they are clearly the ones that have been driving this. Entire term into the ground. It&#39;s painfully obvious that biden is not in the driver seat. They are also the ones that have been lying to you about this man&#39;s mental. Fitness. And they are still lying to us. Don&#39;t be stupid enough to think that You can vote for a better democrat."
228,Does Biden starma?
229,Obama Bin Biden
230,"I have never seen an old man that&#39;s so good at lying, why is everybody only talking about October the 7th,why can&#39;t people talk about what led to October the 7th"
231,Americans help us vote Trump again
232,On president Biden first election I bet he will win and only a one time president! He should allow another Democrat run with Trump ! Otherwise! Sad😊
233,"Biden walks out on stage, because of how used to giving speeches in n company of his close yes man circle he walks onto the stage hearing a roaring crowd chanting <br><br> Crowd- “4 more years, 4 more years” <br><br>Biden waves at the moderators and the crowd. The lights stop him from seeing the waves of people that aren’t actually present because he forgot there was no audience. <br><br><br> Biden- “thank you thank YOU”<br><br>As if he was capping off the audience volume. <br><br>If you watch his speeches you’ll notice the same Means of capping off the audience for a quick rebuttal. <br><br>Biden actually said even more but they cut off his mic"
234,I didn&#39;t like trump that much but I&#39;d rather vote for him than biden that much
235,"&quot;They&#39;re doing more for veterans than ever before,&quot; Biden says. I&#39;m sorry, but with what staff? The ones you pushed out with vaccine mandates before deciding to not require shots after all? The ones who jumped ship to other hospitals when the VA couldn&#39;t match the pay increases everyone else offered to keep up with the inflation your administration caused? The VA I&#39;m in touch with had to cut back on the total number of beds they could fill because they don&#39;t have enough nurses to tend to a full building. A vet that I knew was unable to get admitted for in-patient hospice because the wait list for a bed was just too long."

I am wondering if you ever took a college course in Economics. But if you did, you forgot all the basics.

279,...
280,"Being a Swede, I could answer the very first question about the economy easily. None of them answered the question. They started pissing on each other from the 1st second.

352,"America had a black president that was revolutionary,  America had a business man as a president another remarkable history and now currently  are led by ambitious  nd a dreamer but unfortunately old . I believe the country has proven to the world that they give people opportunities and we respect that. But now it&#39;s not time for emotions nd keeping up with records but to get a true leader to lead the country. America is going down slowly due to its weak leadership . They should check african leaders , every african country that has followed that pattern of emotions nd chrrismetic leadership they are donw nd out.. Goodluck America 🇺🇸"
353,these ppl get on my nerves. let them response to each other before you ask questions. &amp; you keep asking questions like you’re trying to avoid the facts that either of them may be trying to speak. i get that these are important questions but quit asking them back to back like that..
354,God Bless America
355,Biden: “We are the most admired country in the world”..”with the finest history in the world..” Oh my God: this is absolutely hilarious. 😂 Joe coming to Earth for one day after living in the space throughout his life 😂😂😂
356,So many rules feels like a game show 🤣
357,"Big shame , for  America"
358,"Trump again. He will again in the <a href=""http://w.house/"">W.House</a>"

360,Biden sending billions overseas we need that money in America
361,if Biden will win again! China and Russia will be very happy and other nation will not respect Americans! You have one of the softest President the US ever! no more Biden from the Philippines
362,Trump won
363,"Yes his son Hunter ,and Joe can be convicted for  sending and allowing   innocent people who know the truth about your administration"
364,"Biden made sense but he did not speak with authority, Trump lacked sense &amp; honesty but spoke with authority. I prefer a guy who sometimes makes mistakes &amp; is a little physically unstable but has ethics. Biden has not compulsively tweeted like a child having a tantrum or been moronic enough to suggest injecting bleach, he has acted with the dignity his office. Note Trump sidestepped his position on Ukraine &quot;Russia should keep all land it [invaded] now occupies. He also pivoted on the issue of taxing the rich. Illegal immigration actually rose when Trump was in power, he restricted legal migration which could benefit America; building a wall is pointless when illegal immigrants can use boats to avoid it. If Biden continues he must become more assertive as Americans equate confidence with security. It scares me that America may vote for Trump who has a long history of crime, corruption, deception &amp; scandal &amp; &quot;would like to have the full authority of Putin over America&quot;. It seems that America has not just lost it&#39;s judgement, it has lost it&#39;s reason."
365,"Yes the Biden Administration has destroyed innocent people and their families  , innocent people had to go to jail under his administration bc we know the truth"
366,America deserves better..

375,Why dont CNN comment on his speech impediment... i thibk they on his side
376,"oh my God Trump is a terrible man with his antagonising words, so bitter!"
377,A basket of groceries that cost $100 in 2020 cost over $120 now???  Man I need to shop where he is shopping.  More like $170+

385,Bring crypto back
386,"Mostly what I’m hearing is a lot of conjecture and opinion, not a lot of statistics or facts. They’re just playing the blame game. Why do we have to have dinosaurs in office."
387,"When was the last election in 2020, everyone around, including celebrities, hated Trump, everyone was for Biden, Trump was ready to be torn to pieces in the street, in comments on YouTube videos he was hated, you can find these 2020 videos and read the comments. What happened now, people?"
388,If you don&#39;t lower the taxes for the rich they would just take their money out of the country and it will destroy the economy
389,😂😮
390,Made me laugh when they talked about golf😂😂😂

395,"I wonder that this two old men are still strong and eagerness to serve for the seat of president of USA, How luck America peoples for their reasonable leaders."
396,the hilarious show i had ever seen
397,"its hard not to LOL...Biden looks mortified. Is it crazy to question whether he maybe has been fed a false narrative, by a go between. America really has been run by the same people/countries posting their troops (or just ppl whom where strategically coerced) in America disguised as immigrants. I&#39;m not even pro trump, but Joe DID seek retribution, and what&#39;s sad is it&#39;s not even surprising. I highly doubt the founding fathers included the 4th amendment with the idea it could be circumvented by one mans &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot;. America was built off of freedom, yet ppl isn&#39;t even free to control their own consciousness. This is the country that technically defines addiction as a disease but nonviolent addicts take up much of the prison space costing something to the tune of $80,000 each per year...some sitting 20 year sentences for a drug that is now legal and sold in stores....Im willing to bet a ONE time payment of $80,000 would&#39;ve prevented SO much suffering, ultimately getting passed down for generations if used towards prevention, with mental health resources. The LAST thing we need is to fund prisons and police any further."
398,Trump 😎<br>Biden 😨
399,Just take a look at Biden’s face
400,America is COOKED 😭🙏
401,As someone in the military....I CANNOT STAND JOE BIDEN..... ZERO respect for joe biden and his crooked people
402,"I think Donald Trump or Joe Biden shouldn&#39;t be president at all, I think we should have 2 new candidates., Does anyone agree?"
403,Joe should be charged with treason
404,Yall js vote for lana del ray instead tbh
405,"As usual, the Republican propaganda machine snipped the single worst 5 seconds to make Joe look bad, but he gave a vastly superior answer to EVERY QUESTION hands down."
406,TRUMP 2024
407,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1015"">16:55</a> minutes into the debate Biden began a nonsensical response after speaking for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=63"">1:03</a> minutes into his allotted 2 minutes response time. The CNN mediator saved him with an assertively stated “thank you” that cut him off in mid-sentence although he still had time left. She spared him the embarrassment of almost another minute (57 more seconds) of a gibberish response."
408,This is like a stand-up comedy during COVID-19 😂😂😂

416,"Groceries are double, not 20% more... good grief. Fast food is four times more in my area. Their &quot;fact-checkers&quot; for the announcer questions are waaaay off."
417,TRUMP 2025 MAGA !!
418,"I don&#39;t think anyone questioned the USA being the most powerful country on Earth since at least 36 years. But the USA is still a joke to everybody. But where these two senior citizens are wrong: It was not in 2021 and not in 2017 when it started, it started way earlier and gets worse every year. Take this example: the US-President is one of the most powerful leaders any democratic country has.  Yet the debate looks like a discussion in a senior residency..."
419,"Send Biden home to rest and enjoy his remaining fruitful years. He has worked very hard, no need to work yourself till your last breath <br><br>Anyone who vote this man in for another term is an abuser"

451,"Normally I wouldn&#39;t care whether it were a Democrat or Republican, but all I can say from this is that if you&#39;re siding Biden, You&#39;re brainwashed lol."
452,all I got from Biden: &quot;Number One. Period.&quot;

457,Furlongs were not technically job loss.
458,Honestly this is pure comedy gold 😂😂
459,I cannot understand a word what biden says.
460,"Agree to Trump...the world&#39;s blowing because of Biden.. because his business is weapon&#39;s for war...he love war..he love people suffering..he love people dying around  <a href=""http://the.world/"">the.world</a>"
461,Andrew tate for president
462,Biden is a liar
463,Great.👌👍😁
464,Its true.. boarder open because Biden created war..thats why.... He can use to this people for his war
465,CNN hardly gave trump is extra time after each question to answer bidets rebuttal. But Biden was always given that extra time.
466,how is a man who is hardly managing to talk the most powerfull man on earth
467,Whenever I’m having a bad day I read these comments 😂😂😂 yall too funny 😂
468,This is just show. ...nothing else. .is Biden robot or looks like🤔🤔🤔🤔
469,Donald Trump is the man to fix America that is being rejected across the globe for the first time in history . Their military is humiliated and chased out of Africa like 🐕 dogs .
470,"Biden confirmed aliens exist <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4161"">1:09:21</a>"
471,biden is not real 😭
472,"As a Russian, I found THIS both funny and terrifying. I have no idea what is really going on in your country, but I wish you a better leader who will listen and finally hear what YOU guys want and need  inside your country and inside every american family and not what Russia or Ukraine or Afghanistan or anyone else needs or doesn&#39;t need. You got a great country with incredible history and strong people, but it doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have problems inside. But look what these two people are talking about. Putin, Putin, Putin, Zelensky, Russia, Ukraine... and just couple of words about their homeland, about all of you. <br>We are pictured as cold, bloodthirsty haters but that&#39;s not true! We are not that bad. As for me and all people I know we don&#39;t hate anyone, we also want peace in this crazy world and we also want to invite all of you to come and see how we live and to know us better. You&#39;ll change your mond"

474,"I&#39;m a muslim, I support Donald Trump."
475,Total fake news if you don’t post The Real Debate (that had a higher viewership than CNN). RFK jr clearly won over this clown show.
476,For me... I want Trump to be president again..trump mind if for business.. Biden is warpreak minded
477,How is Biden a leader of a nation 😂 as an albertan i can’t stand Trudeau but does Biden know where he is?
478,Imran Khan zendabad ❤
479,"Poor America, they both suck!"
480,"US is the most admired country in the world? Yep, and  an offender is the most admired person by their victims with Stockholm syndrome.<br>I love the US and US people, but I think your politicians should care about the US way more than they do now."
481,What BS Trump talked about? He could not really answer even one question! Baiden is too old to deliver his answers fairly.
482,&quot;We had the greatest economy in the history of our country&quot; I burst out laughing at this...
483,"We need younger men, ALPHA MALES, that excel in business and finance or have had major success running Fortune 500 companies and just a super smart business oriented 35-55 years old that can get deals done that are good for the USA........oh wait I know just the person...... Oh but he can&#39;t because he was not born in  the USA. Who am I thinking of????"
484,Dem two shud put gloves on n fight
485,Trump: The whole world is blowing under him. <br><br>That&#39;s true.
486,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4824"">1:20:24</a> Yeah, I&#39;m sure"
487,"Zelensky is no longer a president, his time elapsed !"

493,Joe must go back and never return
494,This Joe guy seem like the type  person that destroys everything
495,"The population of the United States is over 340 million. Are there not two more decent people among them?<br>They are the humiliation of America, both of them. Is this where your blessed democracy has gotten you?<br>Fix your system."
496,Biden: I created more black businesses than any administration in history.  All I see are black barbershops and African hair braiding businesses.
497,"Someone independent needs to go through this and fact check every word, sentence and fact/ lie they spoke. It would be interesting to see the results."
498,"This season of America is going to be so wild ! I can&#39;t believe this show got more crazy than both Rick and Morty and Black Mirror, yet somehow still manages to be believable ! Except maybe Biden, he&#39;s a little over the top in terms of not being able to make a comprehensible sentence, but i guess it kinda works too, cant wait to binge it !"
499,It&#39;s sad that these two are our options...
500,"Take a sip, whenever joe comes up with &quot;the idea&quot;. You&#39;ll be dead within an hour."

504,There was a wall. Biden dismantled it. Nuff said

521,Trump did not answer about Israel  genocide of Palestinians ?
522,This is so embarrassing.
523,Anyone who would vote for Biden is the problem
524,"President Trump was great! He let Biden say his peace and did not interfere in correcting Biden!<br>Very classy indeed!<br>&quot;Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake&quot;<br>Napoleon Bonaparte.<br>Everything that Biden said, did, and didn&#39;t do Tonight,<br>Is a direct result of his wife, the Deep State, the Swamp, Demorats and the Luciferians using him to keep power! They know that Biden is just a shell of a man and they will try to squeeze him as much as they can to benefit their own personal interests!<br>Shame on all these abuser!<br>What they cannot control is the fact that Biden&#39;s life is in God&#39;s hands.<br>Anything can happen in four Months.<br>In the US, we worship the only TRUE GOD and the only TRUE SAVIOR Jesus Christ our Lord!<br>GOD has everything in his hands and he will give everyone involved in this demonic charade, their due retribution!<br>❤🇺🇸❤🇺🇸❤🇺🇸"

531,"Do you know what everyone complains that Biden is so old and he could kill over, but the moment you ignore that noise and actually listen to what he’s doing, what he’s tryna achieve “aka reverse the stupidly of Roe v Wade”, apart from Palistine and Israel. He seems to know what he is actually doing. Nobody actually brings up anything todo with his policies being bad 😮"
532,2023 did not have the highest temperature in revordered history.  That’s false. That occurred in 1913 in Death Valley…134 °F. The question is not even true
533,Baiden you are a big joke!
534,"Could somebody please explain to me why Jimmy Carter is not presidential candidate, is he not filling good, or there is some other reason?"
535,Pretty good
536,"First of all, I agree that Biden was unsteady, and the Democrats should name a different candidate.<br>But I find it hilarious that the so-called experts say: &#39;Trump won the debate&#39;....<br>Let&#39; summarize his results:<br>1. He never answered the exact questions, and when he sometimes did, he lied shamelessly.<br>2. He was throwing great words like &#39;best ever&#39; and &#39;worst ever&#39; without any foundation or source.<br>3. He was like a whining child from the daycare: &#39;the veterans/soldiers like me better than him&#39; and so on... <br>4. He showed no sign that he has any kind of program for the future administration at all...<br>Yes, if you see HOW they talked, maybe Trump was better, but in a political debate/discussion it is way more important WHAT they say. From a professional point of view it was more meaningful what Biden said... and he was trying to answer the questions he received not to avoid them."
537,Biden needs to resign!<br>Biden MUST resign!<br>Biden MUST resign!<br>Biden MUST resign!<br>Biden MUST resign NOW!<br>❤🇺🇸❤🇺🇸❤🇺🇸

551,"The only truth is that America is sinking. The Democrats are lying to you and if they stay in power, America will have nothing. Donald Trump is worthy to be the president of America because he speaks the real state of the nation, which is the most important thing, he is highly respected by Russia and China"
552,Biden RIP!
553,Biden!!!! Drive!
554,All these tax cuts gonna ruin the country... just like last time trump was president
555,"Drugs and Opiod is every country&#39;s problem, it&#39;s not only in America. You can&#39;t stop it when demand is high. Drugs like Coke, Heroine, Phenta etc. is gonna be there. The most important is stopping the route, the route where it is coming from."
556,"I think I expected better from Trump than what I have heard.i have not heard  any question he has answered,..am disappointed with Trump,..but any way am not American."

565,"A few months ago, I was watching a political commentary on TV in Portugal and one commentator said this: ‘More important than anything that is currently happening in our country [politics wise] will be the outcome of the US Presidential election in terms of the impact and influence it will have on the everyday life of ordinary people’. <br><br>The President of the USA, it turns out, is not only the President of the USA, it is one of the, if not the, President(s) of the entire world. However, only Americans get to vote.<br><br>From an European perspective, no one wants Trump. I wonder if people in the Middle East or other parts of the world are any different. Granted, Putin will probably prefer Trump.<br><br>All I can ask to the American people is to please be responsible when voting, because the world is in a mess, wars in Ukraine, Palestine, Sudan, etc., and your leader is not just your leader. He is one of, if not the, main leader(s) of the world. <br><br>Whoever you elect, it will have very different and profound consequences outside the USA, perhaps even more so than within."
566,Whenever boss Trump speak the way sleepy joe stare at him 😂😂😂😂
567,Asu2an bain it sadar arep bangsa22nys❤

572,JOE DIMENTIA IS THE CORSPE AND CHEIF
573,"I just watched this debate It was.I would say an embarrassing time for both but Mostly for biden. Biden kept attacking Trump And then trump retaliates again again.And again... Like 2-year-olds blaming each other Who broke the window. And Instead of answering the questions. Joe biden&#39;s response in Taxing Large business owners is dumb Because that will drive the prices higher which would Increase the cost of food and clothing further. Anyone that knows basic marketing should know this. Anyways, if I had the choice in picking one of these 2. I would have to pick trump."
574,im  a democrat but this is sad! enough! my state is suffering from the the biden admin! we want change! illegal immigrants are pouring in! we need to stop this! I AM NOT VOTING FOR BIDEN! I VOTE FOR TRUMP~ SORRY! IM DONE WITH MY PARTYS BAD POLICIES~!

Only if Donald Trump would accept his follies then just be real with the Americans he would gain international respect. President Biden is psycally frail but he knows what he is speaking about.

667,"Grocery prices in the United States did not go up by 100%, but they did see significant increases during the recent period of high inflation. Here&#39;s a detailed look at the situation:<br><br>Key Points on Grocery Price Increases:<br>Inflation Impact:<br><br>Inflation impacted many sectors, including groceries, with notable increases in prices. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food at home increased significantly from 2021 through 2023.<br>Percentage Increases:<br><br>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the CPI for food at home increased by 6.5% in 2021, 11.4% in 2022, and continued to rise in 2023 but did not double in price.<br>Specific categories saw varying increases. For example, in 2022, the prices of meats, poultry, fish, and eggs rose by 12.5%, and dairy products increased by 11.8%​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​.<br>Contributing Factors:<br><br>Supply Chain Disruptions: Ongoing disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continued to affect production and distribution.<br>Labor Costs: Increased labor costs due to shortages and wage increases also contributed to rising prices.<br>Input Costs: Higher costs for raw materials, transportation, and packaging impacted the final prices of groceries.<br>Global Events: The Russia-Ukraine conflict further exacerbated food prices, especially affecting commodities like wheat and corn​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​.<br>Detailed Statistics:<br>Meats, Poultry, Fish, and Eggs: Up 12.5% in 2022<br>Dairy Products: Up 11.8% in 2022<br>Fruits and Vegetables: Up 8.4% in 2022<br>Non-Alcoholic Beverages: Up 8.0% in 2022​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​.<br>Sources:<br>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics<br>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)<br>In summary, while grocery prices have risen significantly due to various economic factors, they did not increase by 100%.

737,"Towards the end of the debate, biden didnt andwer the question about weather his age would affect 4 more years, he avoided it and talked about something else completely.and made me 🥱 sleepy"
738,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4585"">1:16:25</a> Biden&#39;s guts murmured to show disagreement😂"
739,What a joke all of it
740,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=713"">11:53</a>"
741,Trump never answered any questions . He was in other planet . Completely lost .
742,biden looks frail
743,I don&#39;t understand why people would vote Trump again. Biden is not a good candidate for his mind problems. But I would rather vote for him instead of Trump. <br><br>White people can vote for him but black people should not vote for him. US citizens have memory lost like Biden too to forget why they did not vote for Trump again. They forgot what trump has done to black people.
744,"&quot;The idea....the idea&quot; that this corpse is president, is despicable"
745,I just saw this and went straight to the comments coz that&#39;s where the real action is happening.
746,Joe needs step down ??
747,"Besides Biden’s dementia, he did absolutely nothing but lie, and repeat old, fabricated, and disproven slanders against Donald Trump.  FJB."
748,Why do Trump hate foreigner in their country.?
749,Why does biden keep repeating himself?????
750,"Let&#39;s play the absurd stupidity  game.<br>I would vote and elect &quot;A MAGIC 8-BALL, DICE, AND USE THE TREASURY TO BUY LOTTERY TICKETS TO PAY DEBT&quot; and solve ALL PROBLEMS before Trump solves &quot;TRUMPS FINANCING, PAYS BANKING LOANS, AND ALL HIS ACTUAL BUSINESS FRAUDS 100% LEGALLY&quot;"
751,Only thing I have seen Trump do is build a half azz wall and separate families only good thing he did was given us those stimulus checks..
752,Thanks YouTube for Playback Speed 2x 🙏🙏🙏
753,Need somebody young new and vibrant in the White House all these old mo foes they put in there both of them look like they have spell senile.😂😂😂
754,Why is everything a lie.....?
755,"Yep, worst."
756,Why does the Biden keep repeating himself
757,Biden from beginning to end he keep lying. Does he think we are stupid? What do you think?
758,This was so funny😂
759,Biden isn&#39;t blinking. Seems he has a lot of botox and probably some drugs to help him concentrate. He&#39;s out because of his performance in the debate. Wonder why he was even a nominee.
760,"Trump mistake number 1; he didn&#39;t shake the hand of his opponent when he walked on the stage.<br>I don&#39;t care who you are, who the other guy is, who is right, and who is wrong.<br>Courtesy, decency and respect is obviously he, and many, many other people don&#39;t get.<br>Has the American society stooped so low?<br>I guess, it has."
761,Trump Is leadership
762,Out of all the individuals in America.. This is what they have.. What a joke!
763,Maybe the People Your Talking to Looks at you as a WEAK PRESIDENT AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU!!
764,Gooooo trump!!!!!❤❤❤
765,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1810"">30:10</a> as an Iranian girl I can say that all the Iranian people thank Trump for that. God bless him."
766,"I think this President B is sleeping the entire debate and he is dreaming, he don&#39;t see himself getting worst..."
767,"Joe, WAKE UP POPS!!"
768,"The truth is Biden spent 1 week at camp David preparing for this debate and I&#39;m sure he knew the questions long before the debate. <br>Also, the lies Biden tells are never ending"
769,Great debate ❤
770,Debates really are better as musicals
771,❤
772,I really hope Biden stays on the ticket just so I can watch a second debate.
773,GOD BLESS YOU TRUMP!! WE STANDING BEHIND YOU 💯!!
774,"Haha what a show! Good luck America,the world is depending on you, ...nope probably boiled down to these 2 guy😅"
775,Hopefully people vote with their head instead of their 🐱 this time
776,Go take your nap Biden!! We Don&#39;t Have Time NOR MONEY ANYMORE TO PAY FOR YOUR CORRUPTION ANYMORE
777,"Debates have come A Long Way Since Biden has been in Office!! IF You Have to have ALL THESE Strickshands Than That Says to me, Someone is Hiding Behind These Strickshands, I Want HONEST Questions ANSWERED!!"
778,"Bidin, you fail"
779,This is onna be a meme for aure
780,Both of these candidates are absolutely terrible - not one of them will even answer these questions.
781,I can’t believe people watch this and actually think that Biden is a good choice. It’s driving me insane. Every time he answered I had a question because he never fully answered.
782,"Tax breaks are universal in the United States. If the wealthy don&#39;t get the tax breaking either, do you so either the government controls you or you control the government? Why should we the people bow down to the government? Hasn&#39;t the government forgotten individual sovereignty?"
783,By watching this debate my confidence got  100x boosted. I also qualify for the position of presidency it seems
784,Trump: Speaking Full Words<br><br>Biden: Constantly Stuttering and Mumbling
785,"Trump was right about everything. It’s time to admit it. Biden is clearly unfit, &amp; he is a pathetic embarrassment"
786,Please I beg off you just be fair and truthful just be honest for once I know that there a people there that know what&#39;s right from wrong search yourself and do what&#39;s right so help you God
787,Un believable. This is the worlds leader!
788,Imagine Trump singing &quot;He Not Like Us”. That would age well.
789,Dementia Joe has got to go
790,"Trump ain’t lying. Unluckily I had to leave my home because it had black mold. Moved me my spouse and our five children in a motorhome temporarily until we got back on our feet. That was 2020. We were sick for a long time after and couldn’t work so we desperately needed help with housing. I was bedridden and my husband wasn’t much better, trying to take care of me and the kids. Out of desperation he had to leave me and go back to work Dec 2023. My husband makes almost 2k a week and we can’t get our credit fixed from the remaining mortgage on the mold house and get a place still because bills, grocery’s and everything is so sky high every pay check is gone quickly and we have nothing left to put towards debt to fix our credit enough to get approved for a place. Been on section 8 for almost three years, obviously i applied years before he went back to working, that’s never been such a long waiting list in Maryland and it is disgusting to see what ppl in our situation are going through in Ny, Chicago and all the other places flooded with people who are getting housing and placement and the residents aren’t. Just terrible"
791,Trump 2024
792,we need Trump back please 🙏
793,Biden waved at an empty crowd 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

812,My father worked his a$$ off most his life for what?? Medications are too expensive and prices on everything has gone up. Yet illegals get to come on over and are furnished with free housing and benefits. What is wrong with our president and government? You just wanna look good while those who actually worked for a living suffer. Biden has done nothing for our veterans.
813,Fascinating.
814,"Biden is disastrous in his speech, even in his body language. He seems very nervous. Biden is finished and Trump is the one who will win. I am not an American, but I follow US news a lot. I have never seen a disastrous president for the United States like Biden in my life. He must withdraw from the American elections. The world under Biden’s rule did not respect America. Even the Iranian terrorist regime is no longer afraid of America because of Biden’s disastrous rule. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2574"">42:54</a>"

816,Its always been more difficult to cross the boarders than then make it out to be . ive had friends relatives a long time ago (2001)  attempt to cross the boarders and died in the process . Itd almost sound like every time that i made a new friend from central america they would tell stories about people dieing on the journey over here . ive also had people say the exact opposite but they were americans . Buddy told me how his dad crossed right into mexico and went to Tiawanna .
817,Billyins and billyins of Jyna.
818,The way I immediately opened the comments after clicking the video 😂
819,I’m not in Biden’s favor but also not stupid to let Trump in White House. Go 2024 Democrats

821,DemonCraps Destroy + Deceive !
822,Should have the three stooges music playing in the back ground.
823,Including Japan.. and South Korea… China’s not so bad. <br>Biden loves Asia
824,"Biden actually was fairly articulate throughout much of the debate. There were a few occasions when he lost his focus and mumbled his way through his answer. Anyway, Biden&#39;s policies suck."
825,Biden’s got the intelligent immigrants’ votes.<br><br>Trump will have the intelligent American votes.
826,"Currently watching this on the morning of the 4th, bad idea. I wanted to celebrate our country with pride and joy today, but after just about 20 minutes of this im losing all hope in our country. What are we actually doing right now people!? this is all so disastrous. At this point it feels like were all screwed, i just hope we all snap back into fkn reality and create a better future for our kids. But regardless of how things are now,Happy 4th to you all and God bless you!"
827,Biden is lying &#39; country far worse under the Democrats
828,Trump never answers questions
829,That 1000 yard Biden stare. Is he on drugs???
830,you can tell biden was given a heavy cocktail of drugs before this so he could debate and he STILL did so poorly. hilarious and tragic at the same time.
831,Bidens team is full of yes man for getting him on stage like this……the guy can’t even tell one story without starting another one mid sentence…
832,Jan 6 = Nancy Pelosi !
833,I think there ready to listen and let people talk
834,Just sound like a bunch of baby&#39;s cry cry cry thanks your waste of time earned you one dollar when someone dies but that person living could have paid hundreds or thousands to do so much more if you could have supported the nation but it&#39;s okay next generation will clean up the mess if we don&#39;t overdose on our pain an issue

907,This was the ENTIRE debate?? I waited until the last minute to see why many people said Joe really messed up and had a senior moment and I NEVER SEEN THAT! I&#39;ve seen him have A FEW &quot;senior moments&quot;  in front of the camera before but not during this debate. I&#39;m stumped and pretty stunned by this. Someone please point out to me the &quot;senior moment&quot; or where he really messed up during this debate. This isn&#39;t rhetorical. I&#39;m really asking for someone to point the moment or moments to me. And FYI I don&#39;t want to vote for either of these candidates and there&#39;s absolutely no bias here.
908,"Trump didn&#39;t lie here. If you buy into that lame excuse to Trump telling the truth, that &quot;he must be lying&quot; then you are a lame lost cause. Open your eyes and wake up. There is video evidence to back up 99% of what Trump said. You simply have to do research and find it. DO NOT TAKE CNN, MSNBC, MSN, ABC, CBS, Fox, news groups word for it. Those news groups are all owned by the same corporation. DON&#39;T be lame and SEEK THE TRUTH!"
909,“We’re paying everyone’s bills” one of the realest quotes for our day.
910,"A liar debated someone intermittently lucid that forgets what question he was asked so just chooses another from the voices in his head.  Considering the population of our country these two people are the best we have?  A convicted felon ran for president from prison in 1929, (3% of the vote) in 95 years we didn&#39;t change the law, this time a felon may win... Both parties need to put forth qualified candidates that would serve with cognitive deliberation on the issues we face as a people and personal integrity.  Go to the many debate fact check websites, evaluate the candidates statements, you will find the debate stage was effectively empty. the debate topic should not have degenerated to porn stars or golf handicaps We need a bipartisan 3rd candidate we can all cross party lines to vote into office so our country will have the leadership it needs."

921,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1728"">28:48</a> Joe: 😆😉😎"
922,Sorry Biden! How many kids you can in the border? Trump finished the war that Barack Obama started. After one month pregnant abortion should be illegal. One month is enough time to for the women to chose and think. About war everything trump says is true and facts
923,Even Biden stops and listens to Trump 😧
924,Let me say this again the price didn’t go up 20 percent it went up 💯 percent
925,Trump will disrupt the currency - as Saudi has pulled out of the petro dollar . Liquid gold key word
926,This is so embarrassing
927,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2167"">36:07</a> Biden didn’t see <b>a</b> ghost, he saw 27🤣🤣"
928,I think all Joe Biden had to do was be awake and he won. Did trump even say anything other than complaining?
929,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1346"">22:26</a> ⁉️⁉️this one counts for trump as a rare truth. that’s true. All the time you will find terrorists from Middle East coming to America. And they’re 2 types.. The first type holding Israeli citizenships. And the second type are the other leaders of the other countries in Middle East."
930,Biden looks Bound and about to cry everytime he speaks🤭
931,"Yes, there where major wars that contained just to europe, the napoleonic wars for example"
932,The combined Age of these two men is frightening
933,😊l
934,Biden running off dial up trying to queue into the match
935,"Biden had his moments and Trump did rant a number of times, but all in all, if Democrat voters have only seen them both on CNN and MSNBC, then they must have been shocked at how gone Biden is ... and how &quot;normal&quot; Trump is."
936,Does Biden know how not to lie?
937,"The  American people dont care about Jan.6, its long been forgotten. Only the liberal media and the democrats  keep pushing it as a big issue.  What we care about most is the uncertainty of the future   under Bidens administration."
938,poor Joe... He&#39;s so old :/
939,The vegetable vs the suit. Easy win.
940,92 percent said Trump won the debate..

943,"New drinking game, take a shot of tequila every time Biden says “and by the way”"
944,<b>Trump win absolutely!</b>
945,"I smell civil war,are you ready."
946,"I&#39;m a foreign to USA but on a serious note, those Democratic Party supporter should be really ashame. I&#39;m sure there are much better adult than Joe so why elect him? He can barely speak also. To be honest I always cough to myself when Biden speak seems like something stuck in his throat. <br>I&#39;m not supporting Republican either but between the two, I&#39;ll definitely vote for Donald. <br>Anyway it doesn&#39;t matter much to me but me and my sister argue better than their debate😂"
947,Trump let Covid inn… them China Planes that landed in Los Angeles if people want to be blind about how dangerous he is… say no more
948,I think President Trump agreed to debate with this guy is because he want the whole world to see how senile Joe Biden is
949,Make the one who is asking questions a president 🤔🥴
950,The Clorox Conman’s hand gestures while’s he’s talking look so ridiculous.
951,The presidency is overrated. Worry more about your own state&#39;s governor.
952,If you think that this is pathetic or funny  . Just remember that this is DEMOCRACY
953,None of the questions were answered.
954,We should have early elections

957,"Ребята, я из России, никого мы захватывать не хотим, это пропаганда! Что мы все пьем водку и имеем личного медведя. Вас дурят, средний класс!  Так же, мы очень хорошо живем, санкции никак не повлияли. Мы так же живем как жили! Только ваш президент передает  деньги Украине, и ваша разбитая техника появляется у нас! Ребята, мы очень дружные, прилетайте, я могу показать вам Москву. А вас очень жалко что ваш президент как &quot;рыбка гуппи&quot; байден явно не в себе.  Мне жаль что ваш президент держит весь мир в напряжении. Рекомендую к просмотру интервью с Такером)   Так же я от души посмеялся с вашего старичка, байден просто персонаж из тупой американской комедии, как  &quot;Очень страшное кино&quot; .  Мне жаль Вас, но если байден останется у власти я закажу себе пива и буду смотреть  обращение Байдена как юмористического персонажа, его глаза, рот, мимика, речь это просто как-будто сюр!!! Ребята, НЕ СЛУШАЙТЕ ПРОПАГАНДУ, ПРИЛЕТАЙТЕ В РОССИЮ, И ПОЙМЕТЕ ЧТО МЫ ТАКИЕ ЖЕ ЛЮДИ) И У НАС НЕ ТАК КАК ВАМ РАССКАЗЫВАЕТ ТЕЛЕВИЗОР! 🗽<br><br><i>____________________________________</i><br><br>Guys, I’m from Russia, we don’t want to capture anyone, this is propaganda! That we all drink vodka and have our own personal bear. You are being fooled, middle class!  Also, we live very well, the sanctions have not affected us at all. We live the same way we lived! Only your president transfers money to Ukraine, and your broken equipment appears with us! Guys, we are very friendly, come, I can show you Moscow. And it’s a pity for you that your president, like a “guppy fish” Biden, is clearly not himself.  I&#39;m sorry that your president is keeping the whole world in suspense. I recommend watching the interview with Tucker) I also had a good laugh at your old man, Biden is just a character from a stupid American comedy like Scary Movie.  I feel sorry for you, but if Biden remains in power, I will order myself a beer and watch Biden’s address as a humorous character, his eyes, mouth, facial expressions, speech, it’s just as if it’s surreal!!! Guys, DON&#39;T LISTEN TO THE PROPAGANDA, FLY TO RUSSIA AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE) AND WE ARE NOT LIKE THE TV TELLS YOU!"

He was so convinced he could still do things himself and refused help from anyone. &quot;I&#39;ll do it&quot;, &quot;doggone it&quot; etc. while incoherently rambling. Biden&#39;s cooked. The best thing he can do for liberals right now is drop out. But he has to do it NOW. If by some miracle he pulls a victory this November, in four years we&#39;ll be so crushed under this inadequacy we&#39;ll pendulum swing to the right and all Trump - or someone worse - will have to do in order to win overwhelmingly is fog up a mirror."
974,😢<br><br>Trump up
975,"are you kidding me that they pulled this guy out of convalescent home, and his facial expression the way he walks what is wrong with this world we gotta get this guy out of office because we know he&#39;s just a puppet and there many people behind him running the presidency"

998,What a pathetic hypocritical media CNN is..
999,"🛑🛑🛑The issue with Covid is that people are still suffering the after-effects of that pandemic. We could see a massive drop in population even years or decades out. We do not know where that train ends. We can offset the taxes Americans pay with import taxes but we need to prepare ourselves for export taxes. It&#39;s time to come together and support this country&#39;s best interests before there is no country to defend. The question: Is the 2 party system working for anyone except politicians and the connected? Is it really? Please explain your answer.  On the incest comment.... that was poor form. Any assault is as bad as any other assault regardless of the perpetrator&#39;s family ties or immigration status. Still, girls and boys like that angel in Houston may very well have been saved if we fixed our immigration system.  We HAVE TO fix the system. There is no point in painting the walls if the roof has a gaping hole in it."

1008,34 Felonies is just a Felonious witchhunt
1009,You got room to talk Biden what about the open border
1010,"I dont trust neither   Its all talk.  Whether they say they will change America  Its just their theory   You want to ask anybody!  Ask the congress/ senate. Their the ones with the Yeas &amp; Neas. Joe might of been slow with answers.   Though Trump never answered most of them neither. More and more warehouses  being built in America.  Who is moving in them.  CHINA 🇨🇳  <br>Why America will not have Soc Sec!  Because robots , electric cars , todays computers will take american jobs.  I see more imagration on the highway construction and new housing with no Americans today in the fields today."
1011,fake
1012,This is not a debate. It&#39;s a conversation about what they are NOT going to do if they become president.

Both of the candidates are of retirement age, and they likely should be. And for those who argue that their experience level is what makes them eligible, are they still the BEST we could find in terms of other factors (physical and mental health, perhaps)??"

1027,"CNN = criminals,.... because where is JFK jr ???"
1028,"The fact that the acronym MAGA is used interchangeably with &quot;extremists&quot; is very concerning. Does the left even realize it means &quot;make America great again&quot;? Why would that EVER be a bad thing? Are the &quot;extremists&quot; trying to make sure we&#39;re allowed to be foolish and kill our babies late term? No. Are the &quot;extremists&quot; allowing their children to watch naked people dance in the streets in a name of &quot;equality&quot;? Nope. So why are Trump supporters hated so much? Is it because we (yes, I am a Trump supporter, I vote for who makes MY life better) simply don&#39;t stand for the idiocy that is the current office? <br><br>I know this was just a huge jumble of questions in the form of a paragraph, but I&#39;m truly scared at WHY people hate a man that doesn&#39;t want our babies to be killed, wants our borders to be safe again, and wants to drill for oil knowing we have some of the largest reserves in the world and would drive down costs exponentially..."
1029,&quot;there was no inflation when i became president&quot; -joe biden
1030,Mr Trump is right we have to stop the killing 🙏🙌👍👍
1031,😂😂😂 Funny. Seems like to children  fighting each other
1032,"This debate was to reiterate that it doesn&#39;t matter who our &quot;world leaders&quot; are because they do not run their countries anyway, so stop playing the game. Focus on local politics. Focus on your families, your neighborhoods, and your communities. Greater is He who is in us (our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ) than he who is in the world (satan)."

1048,Viva trump. Clean up the mess.  Get us back on track
1049,"Dear Americans, I&#39;m sorry, but this was one of the funniest things I&#39;ve seen in a while.😅 <br>Clearly, America needs &quot;fresh blood&quot;, but in order for new people to appear in the presidential race, they must first appear in Congress. And there are now mostly old people with a Cold War mindset."

1059,"The only thing I take away from this debate is the millions of people have died under Biden. I want the wars to end. I want a real economy not a bubble created by inflation, I want American business to hite Americans. How could trump spend more in four years when he faced Covid, yet Biden spent billion in Ukraine. So I&#39;m for trump. I know when trump was in my job was secure, my bussness was secure, I made more money in all my life. Im for trump!"

1067,Can someone put Biden in Thriller video as a dancing zombie please.
1068,Trump openly threatened to incarcerate Biden upon his election during this debate. Biden is obviously unable to complete some of his thoughts. This debate has made me far more discouraged by my options this election.

1078,who is better Biden or Trump???
1079,"First question let&#39;s us all know they both answer to the same master. Biden could have easily called out the money printing during Trumps term being the catalyst that drove up the markets, the stimulus checks gave the boost post covid. That money printing and giving out of free money w/out labor returned is exactly what creates inflation. The effects of expanding and contracting the money supply takes years to ripple out across the market, they both know this and stay silent, because they are on the same team."
1080,The face that trumps makes 😮😒 is enough to intimidate a competitor.
1081,I hate abortion but many states stop birth control pill 🙄 i don&#39;t understand why any state would want to stop birth control 😡 there&#39;s to many women with kids they don&#39;t want and most of them end up in welfare which i don&#39;t think our taxpayers money should pay for these kids 😠

1094,"I have to be honest. I don&#39;t care if the president is Republican, or Democrat, what I care about is what the president can do for America. I feel the same way about every part, every branch of the government. That being said, this debate would have been better if they both would have stopped going back to past topics, and stopped with the insults. They both should have stayed on each current question."
1095,And can you say america isnt fighting a war when america weapons are being used in countries on the other side of the planet. Israel chiefly. But anerica has been war hungry for a long time and foreign policy has to change before we hit a point we cant walk back from.

1111,"Leaving NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) could have several significant negative consequences for a member country. Here are some key reasons why it might not be a good idea:<br><br>Security and Defense:<br><br>Collective Defense: NATO&#39;s principle of collective defense (Article 5) means that an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all allies. This provides a significant deterrent against potential aggressors.<br>Military Support: NATO members benefit from the military capabilities and strategic assets of other member nations. Leaving NATO would mean losing access to this extensive support network.<br>Geopolitical Influence:<br><br>Global Influence: NATO membership enhances a country&#39;s influence on the global stage. Member states participate in high-level discussions and decision-making processes on international security and defense.<br>Regional Stability: NATO plays a crucial role in maintaining stability in Europe and its neighboring regions. Leaving NATO could diminish a country&#39;s influence in these areas and weaken regional security.<br>Economic Implications:<br><br>Defense Spending: NATO members share the burden of defense spending, which can help reduce individual costs. Outside of NATO, a country might have to increase its defense budget significantly to compensate for the loss of collective security.<br>Economic Security: Stability provided by NATO contributes to economic security and investor confidence. Leaving NATO could create uncertainty and negatively impact the economy.<br>Political Relationships:<br><br>Alliances and Partnerships: NATO fosters strong political and military alliances among member countries. Leaving could strain these relationships and isolate the country from important allies.<br>Diplomatic Support: Being part of NATO ensures diplomatic backing from other member countries in times of crisis. This support would be harder to come by outside the alliance.<br>Technological and Intelligence Sharing:<br><br>Advanced Technology: NATO members benefit from shared access to advanced military technology and innovations. Leaving NATO could limit access to such resources.<br>Intelligence Cooperation: NATO facilitates extensive intelligence sharing among its members. This cooperation enhances national security by providing critical information on potential threats.<br>Historical and Moral Commitment:<br><br>Commitment to Democratic Values: NATO promotes democratic values and the rule of law. Leaving NATO could be perceived as a step away from these principles.<br>Historical Alliances: Many countries have long-standing historical ties and commitments to NATO. Leaving the alliance could undermine these historical relationships and commitments.<br>Overall, leaving NATO could undermine national security, weaken geopolitical influence, strain economic stability, and diminish important political and military alliances. The benefits of membership, including collective defense, shared resources, and enhanced global standing, far outweigh the potential drawbacks of withdrawal."

His sharp cognitive decline makes him a threat to Nat’l security, this alone is disqualifying. <br><br>Congrats to President Trump, on a strong debate performance.

Through out the whole debate can&#39;t you see Joe was moving an inch here an inch there, that&#39;s proof he still has a pulse, might be here and there for a split second, but still a pulse.

Please utilize experts who can appraise and scientifically predict the outcomes of your strategies , free from political bias. Republican and Democrats need to work together to make our country happier. The problem is that most of the incentives are based on republican and democrat interests. Very divisive.  Let us solve problems by being objective."

1187,"Both of them have big problems.Trump is indeed in a better mental state than Biden.But both of them are funny.First, the two people have one thing in common, that is, they change the subject whenever the host asks.Trump said immigration several times in the whole video, so I won&#39;t say more.Even if he answers a question seriously, he will still talk about immigration in the end.Because this is his advantage.Let&#39;s talk about Biden.I won&#39;t worry about what he says.I&#39;m most worried about whether he will suddenly die during his speech.Sometimes he can&#39;t even speak clearly.But he has one thing to be sure of.That is, he can answer some questions seriously.I&#39;m talking about medical and educational issues, and so on. These hosts asked them.He can still answer some of these.Then Trump was involved in immigration and who is good and who is bad.Then they were like clowns again.What makes me speechless most is who else they talk about playing golf well.If the host hadn&#39;t reminded them in time, I believe they could have quarreled about golf all day.😅"

1220,“everything is great now” my grocery receipt detected that was a lie.
1221,Trump tells so many lies he can&#39;t remember them all.
1222,No way this is our best candidates to be president in our country. I think old geezers project onto Joe that a senior citizen suffering from dementia can run a country. This is ridiculous and proof this election is a sham. I can find better candidates in my town for president than these two.
1223,"To be honest,  Biden was brilliant but had a slow start. For his age and larger part of his articulation; Biden is surely better than Trump"

I’ve read 75 pages so far of project 2025 so I refuse to vote red, but what person with eyes and ears wants to vote for Biden? I truly appreciate our government and our constitution and I don’t think either of these men reflect or uphold “American Values.” I believe they represent the extremes of our nation, not the middle, and I’m extremely disappointed that both parties chose these men to run head to head again."
1227,If the republicans don’t win America is done .
1228,I don’t know much about American politics but I think it’s admirable how little attention Trump gives to Biden’s half-finished thoughts and trailing off of sentences. I think it says a lot about his character
1229,Can you imagine if an actual audience was allowed to be there?
1230,Is it bad that you got to have headphones because Biden speaks so low.

1242,"Trump and Hillary finished their televised debate very late and needed to eat something to replenish their energy. They entered a bakery together, but both of them found that they had no money on them. Hillary hesitated for a moment, then took advantage of the clerk&#39;s lack of attention and reached out to take three pastries and hid them in her pocket. She whispered to Trump, &quot;You see how smart I am, the shopkeeper didn&#39;t see anything, and I don&#39;t even need to lie. I will definitely defeat you and win the presidency of the United States!&quot; Trump said, &quot;Is it your usual style to act deceitfully and steal in order to achieve your goals? In fact, you can also achieve the same result in an honest way. Look at me!&quot; So Trump said to the bakery owner, &quot;I am the Republican presidential candidate Trump, and I will perform a magic trick for you to show me. Please help me pass this pastry to me.&quot; The shop owner was very curious and immediately gave him a piece of pastry as he instructed. Trump wolfed it down and asked for another piece, but also swallowed it. Then Trump ordered a third piece of cake and took another bite into his stomach. At this moment, the shop owner was a bit puzzled and asked Trump when the magic would appear. Trump replied, &quot;Now is the time to witness miracles. The three cakes from earlier were all in Hillary&#39;s pocket."
1243,All
1244,Equityyyyy is all Joes doing...
1245,Biden reminds me of that scene in transformers 2 when sam is going skitz on in the lecture room
1246,"PCH Chat: We still on live feed great great, What does PCH have anything to do with Trump or Bidens campaigning and please don&#39;t forget you control your own parental controls on your technology. We&#39;re live in Missoula Montana they have Sex offenders in this City. Have a great day and happy 4th of July 2024."
1247,I observed when the host asked a question at around 18 minutes. Pres Biden was the first to answer and also the last to respond to that question. It should be Trump who should answer last. Trump wants to dispute but the host did not allow it. I think giving the other guy more chance to talk more is unfair.
1248,"Federal governments job is not healthcare, social security retirement, marriage all personal responsibility issues. We are personally responsible for ourselves. When you put your responsibility in the government&#39;s hands. You&#39;re f*****."
1249,Joe is calling 81 million people liars and dellusional...
1250,Joe said on video...We have set up the most extensive voter fraud system in the world...
1251,"So Biden didn&#39;t do well, and trump lied about every issue. Tarrifs dont cost other country&#39;s money,  they cost American consumers money.  Exploding the deficit and the national debt. <br> Jan 6th was not an accident, the Supreme Court has been weaponized unfairly, and the amount of Russian influence in the 2016 election should help people to decide who to vote for. <br> Sadly people who parrot fox news bullet points never read the mueller report. The world is watching."
1252,Where&#39;s the third candidate?
1253,They wanted trump tower for migrants...and to destroy DJT#45 &#39;s character...
1254,Trump was clearly better than him in this debate.
1255,"Remember the racism and black people were murdered at the 1980s ? Well this happens again by cops , they are killing / arresting innocent citizens just because they don&#39;t like them ... Yes sir , this is growing on Biden&#39;s era"
1256,Taxing the wealthy produces higher inflation...
1257,I find it very difficult to believe that Biden is only 81 years old. My dad is 91 and he looks younger and talks younger and thinks younger!
1258,"Anyone in the world that watched this extremely unbalanced exchange of words has to ask themselves, how did this man EVER rise to the level of the most powerful position in the country and allegedly accumulate more votes than any president in history???  And I needn&#39;t specify to whom I am referring.  At this point (and for the last 4 years) if you make any effort to DEFEND this person&#39;s credibility, you have forfeited your own."
1259,These men both have led this country. Mr. Trump said years ago that he would never run for president. How is it that a man with just 4 years of political experience just annihilated a man with 57 years of Political experience? The LOOK on Joe&#39;s face says it all when Donald speaks. We have 4 months left until one of these men is gonna to lead the country for the next four years. Can you guess who it&#39;s gonna be? 😂😂😂😂
1260,Joe couldnt even sell a used car...

1265,I wouldn&#39;t ever vote Trump. He sounds full of hate for foreigners..he sounds really evil and purely xenophobic. <br><br>I also could see it when he was lying in his parts of the debate

1306,Has anybody noticed that some comments the like counter doent work??? Hit like and nothing happens??? Always on good comments too... YT shame on you...

1315,Bro America&#39;s cooked
1316,Biden is lost… pretty embarrassing!
1317,Biden is making things up &quot; Trump told Putin to do whatever ever he wants 😮😂&#39;
1318,The US law has no right to enforce credit check for every single move normal people is taking. Neither should they have criminal check for people entering their country. Why? Because a criminal with such dark background is fighting conditate  for presidency and president 😮but normal people can’t have a bank account or rent a place if they have a bad credit ! What’s going on in this country?
1319,"Honestly, Cool look on both, nice suits"

1334,"What a shame, it has a population of 350 million, only 2 people are in the running for the Presidency, both of them are very old, it&#39;s sad for America.😢"
1335,"I watched the whole debate, and I think the best pick for president is Jake Tapper."
1336,"Trump is alot more professional this debate. No out bursts, I can tell they mute mics but still. He looks better"
1337,The only lead role Biden should be offered is the role of Norman Bates in Psycho. The looks he makes 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1338,"People have been saying for the last 2 years or more that he&#39;s senile and not fit to be president, with fumble after fumble, but none of the mainstream media covered it, carefully edited those parts out. Now that they special juice they&#39;ve been injecting him with isn&#39;t working they have to admit it. Or maybe it&#39;s all been a scheme to usher in someone else at the last minute."
1339,Biden pls. we need respect as American citizens don&#39;t ran as our president. I&#39;m  voting for Trump.
1340,Trump handled COVID perfectly 😂

1350,"Trump does - as is done to HIM .<br>Biden is a continuation of day one when Trump Came down the escalator , Chitterlings of impeachment .

1354,Biden is a warmonger. He is enough to destroy the world. We support Trump. Go ahead Trump
1355,Groceries from 2016 to 2020: $150 ....2020 to present: $350
1356,"&quot;Americans support&quot; is also often translated as terror, fear, dead, devastation, hunger, drugs.... Who is a war criminal again?"
1357,"my heart actually breaks for Biden, he looks out of it , sad, stressed , lost. why are they abusing this man"
1358,I cannot believe that Putin would not start a war if he respected a president he entered Sochi during who’s presidency?
1359,Trump 😏😏😏<br>Biden  😯😳😳
1360,Some people have forgotten that gods 10 Commandments said not to kill<br><br>There is never exceptions for abortion
1361,"I don&#39;t really care for neither but trump won when he came up w tons of illegal immigrants and tons of immigrants biden dumped on the Black areas while guys like  both don&#39;t rebuild or build new housing.   He just helped destroy biden Black votes( biden Blacks or super predators  votes?) just won&#39;t happen. Trump lied on Obama be because his constantly jealousy. But towards Biden especially because of Ww3 talk, he won."
1362,"CNN knew he had dementia, they tried so hard Joe but they can&#39;t hide anymore. We knew Joe wasn&#39;t running this country! It&#39;s a joke but unfortunately we are not laughing!"
1363,"Mr Joe Biden obvious got Alzheimer&#39;s ,  the way he look , the way he act, the way he speak , you really can&#39;t hide yourself,  he is not the same person 4 year ago."
1364,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=283"">4:43</a> Biden says seniors can buy any prescription drug for $200 next year, which us obviously a fake promise he&#39;s making to get elected, but later in the same sentence he says all Americans will be able to receive this. <br>What a clone!"
1365,we are so cooked 😂
1366,TRUMP 2024 ❤❤❤❤
1367,Did you count how many times the senior citizen on the right said “the idea” and “we’re in a situation where”?<br><br>The lack of capability he shows is astonishing.
1368,"Biden is like the Internet Explorer.15 tabs open,13 of them frozen and not having an idea where this fkn annoying music is coming from"
1369,Why are elections now picking the lesser of two evils and not the greater of two heroes. Markiplier and Jacksfilms would be better than either of the two.
1370,So sad to hear Biden struggling to breathe and project his voice. He should be checked for his iron levels being too low which can cause that breathlessness. <br><br>If I were in the US and had to vote for one of them it would be Trump. I’m not sure who you are voting for if you get Biden. Who is actually calling the shots behind that man? It’s not him. His lights are on but no one’s home most of the time
1371,Lol😂
1372,"The rest of debates should be done on “X”!<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1435"">23:55</a>"
1373,Im voting for Daemon Targarayen
1374,There’s nothing behind Biden’s eyes. No one’s home
1375,I&#39;m voting for trump bye Biden you lose trump wins
1376,Imagine watching this and supporting either of these old bafoons.
1377,Asked about economy and Joe Biden’s answer is DRUGS
1378,They just arrested 8 terrorist in philadelphia recently
1379,Trump said Biden is the worst president because he cannot stop the wars in Ukraine and Isreal. Putin will never dare to attack Ukraine if Trump is the president
1380,"My president is looking indicted and sceard, rather than being confident and it&#39;s unfortunate"
1381,Next Election will be the most heated Election of all time!
1382,"I find it challenging to hear them speak, let alone watch them speaking. The manifestation of incompetency and immaturity in every possible human respect is just overwhealming. Approximated age of maturity? - Definitely not more than 6 years - more like 3...<br>In a high-school debate they both would have failed. No matter what they said (and did they say anything else then &quot;he is the worst and I am the greatest&quot;?) - they are the &quot;best of the best&quot; whom the US electoral system has been able to filter out to lead the country. And this debate is when they (supposedly) pull their best resources together to win the presidency. <br>If THESE are facts (and everyone can verify them here on screen), then what must be true to make those facts possible?<br><br>If you ask me - CNN, or to be exact the powers behind it, have decided to de-throne both presidents at the same time to give some new to be cooked up candidate a fighting chance. That will be a candidate better equipped to do their bidding, not a candidate to better reign the country."
1383,I&#39;m from Russia. I think it&#39;s Embarras for u.
1384,I find it hilarious that Trump has singlehandedly created a need for a mute button for the presidential debate for the first time in history 😂
1385,"Idk who&#39;s playing biden in this play, but he&#39;s really good."
1386,Just started watching this and it amazes me biden actually believes his own lies like most citizens don’t have eyes
1387,"Biden or trump.who cares ,presidents dont run america"
1388,Can anybody hear what Joe Biden is speaking after half hour....
1389,Sometimes it feels like Biden reading something despite the rules stating their words won’t be influenced or that they won’t be told what to say. His eyes scroll slightly and sometimes he repeats the beginning of a sentence from two sentences ago as if he read a line before by mistake. It happens 3 times. I feel like this debate is heavily swayed in Biden favor yet he still lost. And all the media keeps playing it off like Biden ysed his wit to corner trump. Did they watch the same debate as us?
1390,Let&#39;s go Brandon button &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
1391,oh we’re cooked
1392,super predators 😮
1393,He rewarded the wealthy ? Sorry sleepy Joe.  But I never seen 20 racks in my hand untell trump became president...$20000.  And y&#39;all hated that. I remember.  You wanted to send money to Pakistan while trump wanted to give us even more unemployment instead of that. And you said no    Pakistan first.  Remember. ? I do
1394,America doesn&#39;t have someone decent to represent it?
1395,It&#39;s the womans choice what they do with there bodies
1396,Trump installed border fence at Texas. Biden removed it
1397,Hail trump ❤❤
1398,"ıt is clear that who are the manage  USA ,While Presedents are standing like primary school students ,moderators is sitting."
1399,😊😊😊no😊p0
1400,I fear for the state of the world if Trump wins.<br>Think hard before you vote America.
1401,Heh.    I never had to pay more into fed tax out of my checks untill Biden came it.    Ive had to pay extra  the last 3 years.   And my wages has remained the same.    Hes horrible with everything.
1402,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3928"">1:05:28</a> that THANK YOU!⛔️😑.. Biden shut down😂😂😂"
1403,"Bidden To Just Retire ,Go and Rest"
1404,It felt like I was watching an elder abuse !
1405,the ideaaaaaa
1406,Every single is a lie in all this!!😁
1407,"Thanks Trump for showing people that Biden should be a felon as well. Thanks Biden for revealing the truth that you use your affiliations to hurt people. As it relates to Biden&#39;s affiliations that&#39;s what&#39;s happening to me right now while he&#39;s the president. I wrote the White House as it relates to crimes in my county involving the government and I&#39;m being denied my rights to work, receive benefits, feel safe, usage of electricity and etc; through the government. <br><br>Trump 2024"
1408,NO MAIL IN VOTES
1409,Can Trump speak a single honest sentence?
1410,No ways ! There must be someone lying between the two😂
1411,Biden just serving memes
1412,"Trump: <b>says anything</b><br>Biden: balony, liar"
1413,There should be an age limit on leading a country 😡
1414,"Trump wants  to deal with issues for the now,and Biden wants <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=257"">4:17</a> to deal with issues for the <br>future of USA"
1415,Why does Biden looks like he’s about to cry every second
1416,So America couldn&#39;t come up anyone better than these 2 senior citizens? I can not blieve that
1417,Lie from the start. Live ? It wasn’t live it was 2 min delayed just in case biden screwed up..
1418,I&#39;M MIDDLE CLASS AND I MADE WAY MORE MONEY DURING TRUMP THAN DURING BIDEN.
1419,CNN and Biden both suck
1420,Biden&#39;s all sentences start with &quot;the idea is that&quot;
1421,"The US are the biggest danger for us Europeans. You are pushing towards a war, you want us dead."
1422,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2013"">33:33</a><br>You got the world wrong  . Isarel invaded hamas in 1948. Hamas said, &quot;Welcome to jews and let us live in peace. They said ok. Many yrs later. We saw the terrible war of isarel attacking hamas. Note:isarel wasn&#39;t a country back then. They want to be alone.<br>Thank me later. War continues till modern-day."
1423,the IDEA that this is the best candidate Dems can come up with is OUTRAGEOUS.
1424,Trump entry was awesome 😂
1425,Greetings n well wishes for Donald Trump
1426,"Ridiculous that someone like Biden could run for 4 more years, he looks like he is already finished. Trump sounds great for his age, maybe because he never took drugs like alcohol, cigarettes or other hard drugs in his life. I respect that. Trump deserves 4 more years for sure 💯 ❤from🇩🇪"
1427,Clown vs clown. 😂
1428,"i am not an american citizen, but can we have Obama back?"
1429,High level of democracy 🇺🇸
1430,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shock"">#Shock</a>: Question 🙋‍♂️ why are people so shocked 😮 that @POTUS Sleepy 😴 Joe had a terrible night during the debate? When clearly we all knew Sleepy 😴 Joe had dementia. The only shocking thing is that how quickly mainstream media and others are finally taking off their blinders."
1431,Hoping America brings the change it needs right now 🇺🇲
1432,Not even from America but this Biden dude is funny
1433,"one think that is just coming to my mind now is the russain bashing by the Obarma the Biden addmisistration and the hilery people , they never stop bashing and bashing russian. They try to link trump to russian and they kept that going all made up by hilery, think about it , they dont stop bashing russian or any thing about russia."
1434,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%232024elections"">#2024Elections</a>: @POTUS Sleepy 😴 Joe has been lying 🤥 to us the American 🇺🇸 people throughout his entire career and both @TheDemocrats and Mainstream Media have been shielding  🛡️ and covering up for him for years. They’ve been gaslighting us. Sleepy 😴 Joe has dementia."
1435,"I&#39;m exporting a few stuffs to US and yes taxes went rocketing. Even my customer complaints that the import taxes goes up as well right after they cut everything in the final value fees. I can&#39;t imagine about the macro economy they&#39;re talking about in the debate. Guess people like me just trying much harder to serve a proper food on my table for the family. <br><br>No offense, stop the war."
1436,The ref isn’t biased this time? Do I sense hope?
1437,Tapper is such a punk.
1438,Fake news...you were my favorite to go for daily updates and *real news*🤑🤑
1439,"World respect US he says. Not quite sure with that, hard to respect a president who falls on the even places several times per week. Baiden is a new world-level meme right now, even in this video u can see how he forgets how to speak and move his tongue"
1440,Is this really the best you have America?
1441,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3405"">56:45</a> DID BIDEN SAY CHILD MARKET?!"
1442,I cannot actually believe this went on for an hour and no one intervened. This country has gone to 💩
1443,"Ideally I would never vote for trump....but looking how SHOCKINGLY inchorent biden, I&#39;d vote trump in a heartbeat"

1447,veto Joe and let us know how great trump is
1448,"I see Biden&#39;s lips keep moving, but I can barely hear any sound out of it."
1449,Biden is a sociopathic liar.
1450,Trump only blaming he doesn&#39;t has any vision how things will pan out. Biden also Hippocrates on wars. Both are losers.
1451,Has anyone seen that movie idiocracy
1452,All the very best wishes mr Trump
1453,Guys this debate almost more than 90 mins .you should respect thier age and allow them to sit to start debate. The guys who are asking the questions they sat infront of president. This is disrespect  to them .The Debate pattern should change .how many of you with Me?
1454,Is Biden an AI ?
1455,Once legend says &quot;my friend mr doland Trump&quot; 😂

1468,Biden needs to save this humiliation and retire.
1469,Advice Of The Day: Nobody should be ashamed of being a proud Patriot. There is nothing wrong with wanting to want to put your own country first. America 🇺🇸 is truly the greatest country to live because we’re a welcoming country. People want to experience the American 🇺🇸 Dream.
1470,"The idea that Biden would be an effective president for four more years is simply not true. Come on man! (haha mimicking Biden, but how true it is!)<br>Trump cannot answer a question. You ask him something and he responds with a litany of things unrelated to the question. He&#39;s a runaway train."
1471,wow - choice between a zomby and a harlecin ...... we are <b>****</b> .... and thats the world leader....<br>if i where putin - i would also not respect nato at all...
1472,Hala! Kini jud maoy.klarung.bangag.....parang lutang ba....wat happens?
1473,Basically how this went Donald Trump presented something really good. Joe Biden either looked at him very weird made a frowny face change. The subject said all he said was not true then over exaggerates almost everything he said.
1474,"BIDEN took a nap at -<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1793"">29:53</a> for bout 6 seconds tho no lie"

He has no idea of any statistics of illegal immigrants entered into our country, he has no inkling what the unemployment rate was when he took over the Trump Administration!

1528,"Biden&#39;s smile looks very cute like a child, he is of a very old age but doesn&#39;t have the strength, he moves his head from side to side very comfortably, anger was never seen in the debate,"
1529,So you mean to tell me… that this guy is the only guy in America that has access to nuclear codes and has minutes to make a  decision if something were to go off???
1530,thats a lot of pauses for Biden

1533,"“Brothers, sisters and in laws……”"
1534,Why is CNN hosting this debate
1535,"President Trump you said in a certain video  that we need JESUS in this country, so come back and give us JESUS then remove all lawlessness so that The LORD GOD ALMIGHTY our FATHER should forgive us, remove disasters and heal our country:<br><br>🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼<br>🙏🏼👉🏼John 3:3 NIV<br><br>3 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.”<br><br><br><br>🙏🏼👉🏼2 Chronicles <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=433"">7:13</a>-14 NIV<br><br>13 “When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people, 14 if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.<br><br>🙏🏼👉🏼Romans 10:8-13 NIV<br><br>8 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. 11 As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 13 for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”"
1536,"the saddest thing I have seen in a long time,  just because your rich, doesn&#39;t mean you should be president.  We need intelligent people to be &quot;Leaders&quot;.   All I hear is blaming the other guy.  Nothing good from Either Side.  Guess the USA is off the list of Places Id move to from Canada, as we are fooked as well.    I think my cat would make better decisions."
1537,One love for Donald trump
1538,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=627"">10:27</a> Correct the US looks like a Muppet Show for us Old Europeans."

1542,Gottal love how every single solution Biden has is raising taxes
1543,A tale of two dinosaurs in a bout of bickering.
1544,"From a policy standpoint, Biden is the only choice. The felon Trump should not be running"
1545,😂😂😂from 100$ to 120$ ? 🤔 be real is more like 250$. Why lie so much???. I know people is with me on this one ☝️
1546,That he know he should cut it 😅
1547,Biden trying to bring up morals about relationships while his current wife was his 14 year old babysitter when his first wife died is hilarious
1548,Sleepy joe 👎 Donald trump 👍
1549,It was right out of The Polity of Beasts.  Life reflecting fiction.
1550,Just read through the comments and you will see the real approval rating for Trump vs Biden.
1551,Outback daddy and salami
1552,"SIR BIDEN, Rest, relax and retire. Don&#39;t run for presidency anymore not to ruin USA and your allies."
1553,"This is terrible. Trump just says whatever that comes to mind, meanwhile Biden says nothing at all."
1554,🎶They’re really gonna make me vote for Joe Biden🎶<br><br>I’m going for anything but Trump at this point man.
1555,"Almost everything Biden says is a lie. I watched 20 minutes I&#39;ve heard enough, professional liar FJB"
1556,"I recently watched the debate between Trump and Biden and was struck by the realization that there&#39;s nothing new in politics except for the media coverage and its influence on voters. Politics has always been a horrible, nasty business, driven by emotion, lies, deception, and the hope for a better future.<br><br>It&#39;s baffling that in our civilized society, we still need these gladiatorial showdowns, reminiscent of the Roman Colosseum, where blood and guts seem to be what the masses crave. Despite this, I believe we will survive as an American society. We&#39;ve endured much worse and are still standing. However, if we fail as a nation, the world could be thrown into chaos. It is crucial for our sanity and the world&#39;s stability that we remain strong and united."
1557,Businessman vs DC grifter.
1558,Shame on CNN for denying the viewers and voters the right to Hear Bobby Kennedy the right to participate.

1562,"“Senility” and “being senile” are old-fashioned terms that doctors may have used to refer to dementia. Some people may use “senility” to describe a decrease in the ability to think, concentrate, or remember. A contemporary term that doctors use is “neurocognitive disorder” which might be either minor or major."
1563,Trump 2024!!!

Thank God i bought my house in 2017 and refinanced in 2020 under trump at 3.25% for a 30yr. People cant afford to live now. Current home loans at 8% are setting homeowners up for a default. Property tax has went up. Insurance has went up for the middle class.
1574,Atleast Trump knows how to lie with charisma 😂
1575,"First he blamed inflation on price gouging, then blamed it on Putin, now 3 years later it&#39;s Trump?? He&#39;s gotta go!!!"

1580,Lol....&quot;I&#39;ve seen your swing&quot; &quot;ya his handicap isn&#39;t a six&quot; lol. Both of them are lying at times. Great debate. Made me laugh.
1581,"I normally don’t watch presidential debate but this one I am at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1113"">18:33</a>  it feels  like  watching family guy vs Simpson"

1587,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=213"">3:33</a>  trump’s face 😂😂😂"
1588,"I don&#39;t understand why there&#39;s such a fuss. Biden is running against a convicted felon, yet no one is calling for Trump to withdraw. Democrats should chill out."
1589,"When you are weak so will your military, that&#39;s how it is Biden!"
1590,Is he still reading from a teleprompter 🤣😂
1591,"Biden will start a military conflict with Russia/China, Trump will start a trade war with Russia/China, which one would you pick?"
1592,Trump does not look 78.. I might have to stick to his diet.
1593,Biden: mhhfiusgh <br>Trump: i don&#39;t even know what he said at yhe end of that sentence 😂
1594,Brain dead Joe actually did better than expected
1595,I don&#39;t want to vote either ones.  They&#39;re both not qualified for president.
1596,I don’t want Trump to win i will not vote for for him sorry
1597,This is comedy
1598,Talking about grocery lol my grocery went up 100%  bag of Chips  got smaller and price got higher.
1599,"Who else just dosen&#39;t want either of them as presedent. They both spent more time argueing with each other over frivolous things, rather than answer any of the questions asked by the American people. Why cant we get someone who will acctually be alive to see the effects of there actions in office to run for president. I hope that this display of utter incompitance by these two will change the veiws on our government, and get more youth to start voting for there future, not just Internet clout wars between liars in suits. May god bless us all if either of these two are are really our only options to choose from as the face of our country."
1600,3rd time voting for Trump-2024!
1601,Dr phil visited the border! He interviewed borderpatrol
1602,"The whole will run away from America due to such current administration of Biden. Biden instead of being the world&#39;s president, started to divide the world by taking sides to support only the countries that are NATO members. This means the rest of the world that is not NATO is going to be brushed off! And that is unacceptable before such actions to happen."
1603,Trump was very very very good.
1604,I&#39;m a Military Veteran and I always hear &quot; Thanks For Your Service&quot; but this Country treats me like a third hand citizen 😢

1615,The immigrants are getting our Social Security. We paid into it!!!
1616,"If  Trumps departs,  which I&#39;m not against, but here goes three-fourths of my  my neighborhood.   I agree that our country has become a third-world country  now, in the eyes of world."
1617,If you listen very closely at Around 1 hour 16 minutes and si many seconds when Trump is talking about tariffs it sounds like Joe crapped his pants. I thought it was him swallowing but its not. I&#39;ve watched it like 5 times
1618,"these guys are just blaming each other instead of talking about issues. They be like &quot;he&#39;s the worst...he&#39;s stupid&quot; the other &quot;no, he&#39;s a lier, he&#39;s dumb&quot;"

1623,All i heard from biden was &quot;The Idea&quot;!
1624,"It&#39;s fun, it&#39;s awesome"
1625,"There is so much to hear between both candidates. I am 20 years old and have never been so intrigued in politics in my life. Wanted to watch this debate because I just wanted to see how joe Biden would do, and I knew he was not gonna compete well enough. I do not like Biden for he destroyed this country. Trump did great as MY president he is not a close person in my personal life, so why should I care if he did F*cked a pornstar all those years ago, and if he lied about it so what. I do not know the full story of Jan 6., but we can not just sit here and listen to he said or what she said. Apparently Jan 6 was really bad people got hurt/killed and trump did nothing about that, but I have not looked into it to see proof or what, but again how can I trust that info when i cant even trust what i see on YT or whatever. I don&#39;t know what is a lie and whats not, but what I do know is that everyone is now in complete shock when the see Biden on stage by himself completely fail at his job. how in the world did the dems not see this coming. trump did his part and in 2016-2020 there were no wars there was no inflation, my dad was not struggling this much, I heard nothing about the border or Afghanistan. I just wish people really take a look at this debate and see why trump would be a better president. I would rather have a person who looks strong and can talk, AND also has a past of doing great things. I just wanted to rant because I am truly scared if  biden or any dem under that biden party wins."
1626,"Bonnie Sando is for be the President!! Bye to the lord ,  Trump cannot be a President, we all will die. We will start a war bye to the Lord. We have to be together jump.

Brother, instead To the corporation wake up, trump cannot be a president bye to the lor bom  Bonnie Sando It&#39;s To be the prison.!!"

1630,Elder abuse! He needs help
1631,The corporate blues and reds 🤣
1632,"So Biden’s media spins untrue, salacious headlines and he just regurgitates them during a debate. He has yet to present any solutions to problems our country faces under his watch."
1633,"America is interesting, if Putin is a war criminal when he is at the receiving end of NATO trespassing what does that make America who is bent on making Ukraine a NATO colony against all border and regional security control agreements 🤔"
1634,Neither candidate can put forth a persuasive argument on any topic. It&#39;s so sad.
1635,"joey, you lost me the first moment you walk on stage!!!  (Because you lied about everything!!!)"
1636,"Does anyone else think Joe Biden had an ear piece in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3010"">50:10</a> mark Joe to me clearly is listening to something else and is shocked to hear it."

1638,biden got destroyed

1657,biden makes no sense
1658,A new generation of politicians must arise. The good old Grand parents are loosing their tracks and have no idea about new world and challenges. All we saw in debate is enmity towards one another and baseless rhetoric and overhyped minimal achievements.
1659,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1123"">18:43</a> How is going to restore Roe v. Wade?? He’s not. That is a blatant lie. If it is restored, it won’t be until the Democrats have a majority in SCOTUS, which will be at least two decades, if ever."

1696,This can&#39;t be real. It&#39;s worse than a nightmare. Worse than a bad written comedy. An announced tragedy indeed. Feeling deeply sorry and embarrassed for all the people living in the US. Would be better to have no choice than choosing between these two. Unbelievable and surreal. And unfortunately it will affect the whole world too. What a mess!
1697,"Bro saying raising tax on the rich to 24 to 25 percent, just to save a billion dollars over 10 years, how&#39;s about cutting that 8 billion we give to Israel every year 😂😂😂😂😂😂"

This Alzheimers or Dementia will get worse, quickly and if youre honest, you must know that deep inside! It is very likely he will not survive the next 4 years in office. This is cruel towards every citizen who will suffer, the more his brain will start shutting down and  it is also cruel towards Biden himself for having to spend these last years he got left being pushed to cling onto power instead of spending it with his loves ones. This is SAD."

1772,I feel bad for President Biden. I don&#39;t see him being the President for another term. He needs to chill out and enjoy his golden years. I don&#39;t know him personally and I was underwhelmed by him but he is but a mere mortal and needs to be taken care of by his family instead of being pushed into another term by them.

1823,this country was built on imigrants ands still does
1824,"Baloney. I own an excellent small commercial and highly qualified lock and security company in San Diego CA. It was cranking under Trump. After 2020 and Biden... we continued and have always done well, grossing over $1M a year, but the train went into a bit of a ditch.. Business slowed down. There&#39;s no reason for a lock and security company to slow down if you think about it.  And then there&#39;s the current governor of California and the jerks in Sacramento who want to gut me as a small business owner. My company was way busier when Trump was in and everybody was running and gunning..We were running like headless chickens. The commercial and industrial market was hammering! My customers had money and plans. There&#39;s still good construction going on in San Diego, but the interest rates, inflation, and regulations, and whatever else, have an arm around the neck of a company like mine. I think San Diego may be the the most active in Southern California, more than LA, Orange County, and Riverside County for projects and opportunities. But Biden and Newsome...go buy a couple of vans and live down by the river."

1897,"Biden handled himself, and carried his part of answering questions a lot better than Trump did, too often dismissing the question with a review of what Biden said or did wrong. <br>If Trump had not have dismissed so many pointed questions, I would almost be swung ‘his’ way.  Looks like I am going to have to back to ignoring the faults of the man both of them, and stick to my points, as an Independent, about the Issues.  That said, I don’t agree that Bidens age threw the debate for his campaign."

The president&#39;s don&#39;t matter let&#39;s find who&#39;s actually running the country and ask them questions and demand things from them.

1950,Why is Robert F. Kennedy Jr not there in the debate? Why is the choice of the American people curtailed by the CNN? Why is the debate between a senile old man and the sex offender being peojected as the only  choice of the people of Anerica?
1951,People better understand that security cost and the resorts is sending to the contention walls because do you want to wake up a live we must cooperate and sacrifice vacation for your kids future

1955,"TRUMP DESTROYED BIDEN,,,,,!!!!!!!!!!😊"
1956,"Finally watched it. Despite the evangelical squad recruited to make noise online, if one takes into account the content, Biden unsurprisingly was a league above. Yes, his speech is blurred, that’s not the most important thing. I am a non native speaker, listened at x1.5 speed and had no problem understanding."
1957,The candidacy of Donald Trump looks stronger but still may not be the most suitable candidate for the position at stake.

1978,Joe’s been milking that Scranton line for the last 50 years that he’s been a Washington insider.
1979,This is peak cinema as a foreign
1980,The idea😭😭😭😭
1981,"Say what you will about Biden. At least he cares about stopping climate change.<br><br>Trump pulled the US out of the paris accord because he deems it too expensive. It&#39;s to save the world man, just pay for it."
1982,"Is this a joke? Bro, Putin is a serious politician compared to this"
1983,This debate is so cringey. It&#39;s hard watching that old demented guy stand there and pretend he&#39;s all there. Geez...

1991,I votedTrump the first time and Im voting him again..
1992,Love him or hate him..Trump did every single thing he campaigned on in four years. Meanwhile Biden is promising things again just to get elected. Won’t do it.
1993,We&#39;ve finally beat medicare 😂😂😂😂😂
1994,Biden it&#39;s done
1995,Look at these comments. If the votes and the states has Biden re-elected do we really trust our voting process? Scary and hopeless feeling if the fraud is not fixed and the nursing home patient wins. 😵‍💫
1996,So you want to force billionaires to pay higher taxes?  That&#39;s not fair.  All people need to pay same type of tax on income.

2003,Biden had four years and he hasn’t done any of these things he’s talking about. His ending statement.
2004,Donald trump took credit for everything President Biden has accomplished and threw his failures on Biden. Everything trump said was literally a lie! Biden wins this by his truths alone no doubt! Donald trump is a pathological liar and its disgusting America. Trump insults America&#39;s intelligence and we can&#39;t continue to let him lie to us with a straight face. Biden definitely struggled but good God at least he was telling the truth!
2005,"Biden&#39;s expressions whenever Trump talks is going down history as the greatest piece of comedy of all time, especially with the amount of absurdist value it carries."
2006,Not as heated as 2020
2007,"I voted for Biden four years ago. If he really cares about this country, he would step down and not run! So many Americans don&#39;t like either candidate and many will not be voting. If someone else would run for the Democratic party, they would have a much better chance of winning this presidential election."
2008,@gladwellmokome7245<br>0 seconds ago<br>Such a proud moment to be a African. These two are behaving like they are running for presidency in the BANANA REPUBLIC not the mighty superpower.  PUTIN IS WATING AND HE IS LIKE URRRRA

2011,We vote for biden
2012,Why do Democrats think it&#39;s the rich&#39;s responsibility to pay for the national debt? Why are we responsible for government over-spending?
2013,"Wow. Biden has obviously received the questions weeks ago and has been practising the answers ever since. He talks without any conviction, just like someone who has to learn word for word, without understanding anything. Total clown show. Anyway, after watching for 10 mins. I am done."
2014,"I&#39;m Spanish right, and I hear that why do you think black families are suffering for this or that, and I&#39;m here thinking, why they separate black problems from white problems? Like from my understanding here, most black people in America act and dress like In a rap music video, and from my understanding, black on black crimes are really high and there&#39;s lot of black people in prison in America, so my humble opinion is there, but again why they separate in colors like what&#39;s the point.<br>PS: here in Spain there&#39;s lots of illegal inmigration and I would like a president like Trump or Poland tbh it&#39;s getting out of hand."
2015,Just watched jb is a liar! 🤥
2016,"Number 1, number 2, numb.... 😴😴"

2030,"That&#39;s not <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23therealdebate"">#therealdebate</a>."
2031,"personally I wouldn’t vote for either, bc we have examples like the El Salvador president ( which I’d rather have over these two) but Donald is our best bet at this point, sleepy joe is a joke."
2032,I like and love 💓 Mr Trump personally. But I don&#39;t want to see him in the next term.<br><br>Mr. Biden is sick and ill. But he is better for the American people and the whole world 🌎🌍.
2033,People said President Biden did not hold Trump accountable for the lies in this debate... He held him accountable for quite a few lies at quite a few points. I don&#39;t see and understand why people have said that.
2034,Joes explanation of the trimesters of a pregnancy is a little off
2035,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=976"">16:16</a> “did he just immigration abortion” 😂😂😂😂"

2063,"Biden is the master mind why there&#39;s war in Ukraine and Russia, war in Israel and Pakistan and conflicts with Philippines and China 😢"
2064,"The irony is, after this debate, it is 100% OBVIOUS that Biden is NOT running this country!  How could he?!?!  If that IS the fact, we want unfettered access to the OVAL OFFICE, we want to see him DAILY, in action, not HANDLED, but day in day out dealings, clearly there will be private meetings, but there will be way more non-private meetings, events, discussions, etc.!  SHOW US VOTERS BIDEN IN PRESIDENTIAL MODE ON A DAILY BASIS! Not cherry picked events or footage, not question and answer periods where he is fed info in his ear, or someone PULLS him away!

2066,Poor guy    He needs to stand down and rest
2067,"Trump never mentioned all the deaths of fentanyl under Biden <br>He never mentioned Biden ending support of all our police forces, and Police deaths,<br>Trump didn&#39;t even have to mention all the rioting and stores being broken into and stolen from, and closing.<br>Trump never mentioned Biden letting illegals destroy Texas homeowners property, they had to take the law in their own hands. Biden did NOTHING about it.<br>Trump didn&#39;t mention the schools butchering and confusing young children and exposing them to harmful books<br>Trump didn&#39;t mention the money Biden cost the US for taking down a border fence that was almost completely built.<br>Kamela never made it to the border, She didn&#39;t even know she was speaking in South Korea!

2080,If this doesn&#39;t wake people up to how incompetent Biden is I don&#39;t know what will
2081,The first and the last debate.
2082,I think it was the first time i heard Biden even acknowledge the election fraud. Throughout all of it he acted like he just didnt need to say anything but anyone whose not an idiot knows they stole the 2020 election. If he had any class at all or actual concern for uniting the country then he would have taken an active stance in investigating and disproving it but he knew he couldnt. He has always been and always will be a fraud.
2083,Top 3 Biden phrases:<br>- That&#39;s simply not true<br>- The fact of the matter is<br>- The idea that...

2091,ALV los países de SudAmerica están quemando a todos lo mexicanos que venimos a chingarle MAKE AMÉRICA GREAT AGAIN Thank you Boss GO TRUMP GO TRUMP best president for us construction workers
2092,I think Biden has an earpiece. Someone telling him what to say. You can see him concentrating on the voice.
2093,Biden got demolished it was beautiful 😍
2094,"It’s since came to light that there where up to 250 FBI agents in the crowd that went into the building on Jan 6th,LET THAT SINK IN 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧WHY WHERE THERE THAT MANY AGENTS THERE 🤔😳"

2096,"dumb and dumber, I feel sorry for my Neighbors to the south"
2097,Honestly Biden should never have continue running for president his inability to produce a cohesive sentence is whacked.
2098,"Trump made a really good point at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=920"">15:20</a>- you have to get elected to get anything done. The implication which he hints at is that means you may have to say things you don&#39;t really believe just to get elected."
2099,When they started taking offense to the golf comments 🤣
2100,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4902"">1:21:42</a><br>&quot;The idea that somehow we are this failing country, i never heard a president talk like this before&quot;<br>Dude literally said the same thing about our country under Trumps presidency...<br>Look at all the hypocrisy and lies!"

2106,America what is wrong with you ?:( Is this really 2 best men ?!  Guys your screwed !
2107,"When Biden says he doesn&#39;t have to, he lies again and again. Joe Biden I don’t feel, and I don’t think you’re helping and standing by us. Bye Joe."

2109,Nithing concern me on the debate. November coming close 17 millions views better cash out
2110,It&#39;s the fact that not one of them actually answered a question that does it for me 😂😢
2111,Biden the sky is blue and its impossible for a ant to stand on a elephant while the cat is at the barbershop.
2112,"absurd reality we live in. A clown and a zombie..... I am not siding with the Zombie, but yall are absoletely crazy to think Trump would ever care about anyone other than himself. Trump first, not America. Give him full control and he will do as he did with his companies, get as much money out of it for personal gains as possible before filing for bankrupcy. Investors see no money coming back, because &quot;it didnt work out&quot;,  but what did work out is his wealth in reality increasing as opposed to his wealth on paper. If you go by the papers, the only thing he has in terms of money is his tax-debts."
2113,"It&#39;s sad that Biden did such a terrible job because, YOU KNOW they gave him (not Trump) the questions ahead of time."
2114,"Let&#39;s REALLY BE HONEST, it doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s in office, just take a moment and think, all the &quot;President s (pre-seeds) the world has continued to get So much (better 😂)joke   4 the people in the bleachers. The country has been led astray 😢"
2115,"If Trump is ready to leave Ukraine and occupied territories to Russia now, tomorrow Trump will leave Alaska state to Russia within one day."

2117,I like how the debate rules changed to protect Biden and he still got destroyed 😂
2118,Biden *speaking gibberish. Trump: I really don’t know what he said and I don’t think he knows what he said either.
2119,"As a minority, i made the most money i ever had under trumps leadership. Made more, dollar went further."

2129,Trump massive landslide incoming.... 🇺🇲🇺🇲
2130,In New York City it’s illegal to get an abortion after 6 weeks
2131,"Biden is too old, Trump doesn&#39;t deserve to be running after he incited a riot after losing the last election. This is the democrats and republicans way of spitting at the voters showing you your vote doesn&#39;t matter by giving you two of the worst possible candidates to choose from lol This election everyone should vote for anyone that isn&#39;t a D or R."
2132,Is that a Biden clone?
2133,Lead Pipes lol
2134,Poor biden looks like a smacked baby every time Trump brings up his major failures. He doesn&#39;t perk up again until Trump tells a lie. If Trunp was capable of sticking to the truth Biden would be  in tears.
2135,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4585"">1:16:25</a> someone had an accident😳"

2162,Why people are soo poised against Trump and support someone who is clearly a former hero and man of state but a lovely elder in need of care instead of being used and abused as a puppet - sad :(
2163,"Please cease and desist from associating and besmirching the good name and morals of our members with this clusterfk.-signed, The Alley Cat Association of America."
2164,I feel bad for Americans for having such a special ed President
2165,I lose brain cells every time I hear Biden speak
2166,"As someone who voted for Biden in the first election, I gotta say…….. <br>My stance on him has changed. The long and short of it is, HE IS TOO OLD!!!! I mean, Jesus Christ and Fries! There was NO one else? Seriously. I cannot support having an almost 82 year old man for another 4 years in office. No offense to our seniors out there but no thank you on Biden. He had a good political career, I’d give him that but it’s time to just enjoy retirement. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23changedtotrump"">#ChangedToTrump</a>."

2177,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=134"">2:14</a> He almost got lost.😂"
2178,The fact that they’re calling poor colleges “black colleges” and rich colleges “white colleges” is inherently racist. THERE IS NO SEGREGATION OF RACES IN COLLEGES. Say low income. This is elementary.
2179,Where is redemption?  Look up the word in dictionary
2180,Biden blaming trump for the economy during his time as president when we held our ground outstandingly during Covid is a joke

He’s always been crooked and not politically impressive.<br>What bothers me is he’s sick, not his fault, but the malicious people around him only want $$$ and power regardless of how much they despise and have tried to destroy the average American and America 🇺🇸 <br>Biden is obviously in a severe cognitive decline that deserves our sympathy.<br>My beloved immigrant mother died at the relatively young age of 75 due to advanced Alzheimer’s.<br>So this issue hits me very close…."

2195,"Can everyone please listen to what they&#39;re actually saying. We make wise decisions when we&#39;re listening to both people and forming our own rational conclusions. Biden might be stuttering and old, but some of the things he is saying, mostly at the beginning, do sound more concrete than what Trump was saying. Trump sounds more audible, but the things he&#39;s saying are more harmful."
2196,"TRUMP FOR PRESIDEN TO HAVE A BETTER COUNTRY , GREATER ,SAFER , AND RICHER , PEOPLE PREPARED TO WORK FOR USA ."
2197,FJB! TRUMP 2024!!!

2204,"Instead of slamming each other, answer the important questions. They’re both little babies."
2205,"Trump: confidently stated whole lies, half truths and fabrication, gaslighting about ⚪ supremacy, and not answering a single question. <br><br>Biden: mumbled, was very offended at &quot;the idea&quot;, and defended genocide. <br><br>Neither are fit"

2219,Don&#39;t forget that he has the power to start a nuclear war
2220,"With the best of everything, how did nothing get done?"
2221,Every time Biden says “if I’m elected I’ll do “x””. <br><br>Why have you not done it already!? Why are you waiting till 2nd term?

2237,"the whole idea is to see that Biden can&#39;t hold the position , so the next step will be to replace him( with our agreement ) with Kamala or even worst Hillary . this is the plan , remember what i said"
2238,Trump is funny like Joe Pesci. &amp; Biden&#39;s funny like a parody.😅

2257,"This is unacceptable.    Only two options?<br>Neither candidate came out and said I want to be president of the United States of America.<br>I am so very disappointed with the closing speeches,     neither said I want to be president because.     Trump did say and explain why he wants to be president again during the debate,   I just wish he would&#39;ve made that his closing speech.      Both candidates make the position seem a burden, only worth fighting for bragging rights."
2258,"In my opinion, Biden has to be replaced as candidate of the Democratic party with Obama"
2259,CNN Has their comments locked. I&#39;m excited to go through these 😂😂

Albeit neither of them are the most appealing candidates by any means necessary and they <b>both</b> lie, Trump frequently more than Biden.<br><br>But this election is going to be close and neither candidate is a favorite at all I feel like. Politics is sickening 🤮 but this comes from someone who is not all informed.<br><br><br>I mean what it comes down to is this for us: We have a choice between a creepy, comprimised coot and a conniving criminal. . . . ."

2382,Cnn gave Biden the questions and he sure is playing with his earpiece i mean ear a lot
2383,"The last one to go home... Please, turn off the lights!"
2384,Just an outside perspective since I&#39;m not American. Points made by Trump were towards the questions. Points made by Biden were towards what Trump did wrong. Then Trump was then obligated to correct Biden. It was a vicious cycle.
2385,how many number one&#39;s and numbers two&#39;s did this man spit in this debate lawl
2386,Biden&#39;s already dead ... BUT someone has forgot to bury somehow.<br>RIP Anyway.

2396,"people want biden at first because what he promise people but now that they see what he can and can&#39;t do, We sure need to change him"
2397,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4869"">01:21:09</a> What is Biden on about now? <br><br>Trump sent high-tech manufacturing jobs over to china from usa? <br><br>Is he talking about what happend multiple decades ago in tech manufacturing industry in general but blaims Trump for it, <br>or about Trumps last term in office?<br>I think it&#39;s widely known that Trump was always against moving manufacturing abroad, this has been pretty well documented.<br><br>Besides, Im pretty sure Trump did the EXACT opposite during his last term in office. <br>He initiated changes and tax breaks to move tech manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.<br><br>Seems Biden is outright lying about things saying Trump has done X when he did the opposite and gets no recognition from our beloved media. <br>But plenty of fools in comment section cryin about how Trump lies without given examples and never owning up to any outright lie from their own side, yet people like to play psuedo intellectual and say &#39;both sides are just as bad&#39; without even knowing much bout anything..<br><br>Naah, thats cool. Just keep hating Trump, even though you barely know why. <br><br>Do your hate thing 😎"

2416,Trump 2024❤
2417,We finally beat MEDICARE!  YAYYYYY!!!
2418,"&quot;We call it migraine crime, I call it Biden migraine crime&quot; 🤣"
2419,"Watching this now before it is getting deleted. Bye Biden, the nursing home is shouting your name, it is time."
2420,This is idiocracy in real life
2421,Ukraine average age of soldiers is 45 smfh. Our proxy war wiped out a generation. All war over energy. Hunter Biden on Ukraines energy board. How did blowing up the nordstream pipe line help the climate. Largest release of methane gas ever! Black rock controls our government...
2422,Trump is violent
2423,You know each of them embellish everything stated. Biden really looks taken back; like its his first time dealing with face to face competition though. In disbelief that he has to find ways to counters how untrue a statement may actually be. 😂 <br><br>Y&#39;all in &#39;murica are a riot. 💀 Best TV series to date. Replaced Jersey Shore for me years ago. 😂
2424,Trump limpio el piso con Biden..
2425,RFK Jr 2024

2427,"Bi❤den  is good for us and 😊for everybody, <br> <br><br>not t😏rump"
2428,"This looks like an SNL skit to me.<br>Thanks for keeping the comment section open btw. CNN has closed it down. The &#39;only&#39; media who &#39;uphold American values&#39;, the &#39;saviour&#39; from Trump&#39;s fascism, have turned off their comment section. Freedom of speech and all of that is rolling in their graves."
2429,Biden - &quot;The Idea.....bla bla bla... the Idea..... bla bla bla... thr Idea.&quot; 😮
2430,Trump bunch of lies.
2431,The next ERB is gonna be amazing
2432,"I dont usually commend cnn bc they are phake nooz, but whoever made the decision to Split Screen did the Right Thing!!<br>But they still want us to not trust our lyin&#39; eyes.😮"
2433,I think Biden could still win the debate with that hoarse if he was more aggresive and styled after Clint Eastwood from Gran Torino 😂
2434,What about other contestants?
2435,This was hard to watch
2436,"As a current military member, Nobody has done more to hurt us than Biden. Since he came into office and slashed our budget, and changed laws regarding how we got our financing, and gummed up the budget approval in the senate over and over again. I&#39;ve had more training exercises cancelled than i can count due to lack of funding. We had our pay delayed months at a time. Imaging not paying your military members on time. How could you do that and say your helping anyone? let alone veterans? Trump cares for our troops and has proven it through his actions. Biden hates our military, and using his dead son as an excuse to try and look better is shameful. This debate really shows how inept Biden is, and i think we are all wondering, who&#39;s really pulling he strings behind the mask."
2437,Every word out of Biden&#39;s mouth is a lie. He&#39;s lied so much throughout his life he doesn&#39;t even know he&#39;s lying at this point. Nobody is fooled by him. He needs to ride off into his twilight years into a nice cushy nursing home paid for by the millions of dollars he&#39;s acquired illegally during his career. It&#39;s embarrassing that our great country has him at the helm. God help us all! Vote Trump 2024!
2438,“I wouldn’t be here if he was a great president” that was the clincher!<br>Trump 2024 you got this Mr President. 🇺🇸
2439,It is literally an old man vs. an ultra large capitalist bro. none of them are suitable enough
2440,Even the CNN guy still calls him president Trump😂😂 nobody f*<b>*</b> with Biden bro😅

2452,I can out of watching this a lot worse after watching Biden!<br>I don’t want to live that long if I turn into someone like him🥲
2453,"what a disgrace, all of Biden&#39;s answers were rehearsed, these are terms he memorized &#39;the idea&#39; listen to how many times he says &#39;the idea&#39; and number 1 and number 2 and number 3. He has no idea what he is doing and I&#39;m shocked he was able memorize anything. He will be 86 in his last term. I can&#39;t imagine him being able to stand and eat on his own in 6 months. He was weak 4 years ago the level of decline with the best healthcare and doctors can money can buy at his disposal shows just how bad his current Dementia is. Trump is mentally stronger but just as dangerous if not more so, god help us all, end of times are upon us."

2465,😂😂The American president people. What a disgrace. The greatest enemies of Americans are those master minds that want to keep President Biden in the office so that they continue controlling US they way they want.
2466,We should not vote for either of these elitists.
2467,An international magazine said a Russian government jet flew to New York and Washington on the 26th.  On Friday it was parked by Trump’s plane in Virginia where he was giving his campaign speech. Why isn’t anyone talking about that too?
2468,No studio audience 😂😂
2469,Everyone keep in mind that joe Biden didn’t get elected …he was appointed by tyrants in the United States Democratic Party and the Chinese communist!! This is the most ridiculous debate in the history of this country!!!
2470,You people need to fight to keep our Democracy!!!  No one is safe in a Dictatorship!  Ask the Canadian couple that moved to Russia in favor of their Christian beliefs.  Their bank accounts were frozen.  VOTE to SAVE DEMOCRACY!!!

2495,I am worried about that when Bidden fall down 😂😂😂😂😂
2496,My vote is for TRUMP
2497,"Poor Joe, Trump is a real bully. I mean from a charisma perspective, obviously Trump comes off as the more &quot;fit&quot; individual, but I dont think I can count on two hands how often he brought up the &quot;millions of millions&quot; of immigrants that supposedly live in five-star hotels in NY, and similar fear mongering. Sure, the situation at the border is bad, sure there are some bad people coming in, but he&#39;s blowing it hella out of proportion. Meanwhile Joe makes more points akin to normal politics but he sounds like he hasnt had a glass of water in 14 days. Im not American so thankfully I&#39;m spared of having to choose between two geriatric dudes... my heart goes all out to all Americans who have to live with this dire situation."
2498,Trump is a liar
2499,We in Asia are so happy to see stand-up comedy show in the white house

2503,Trump is a business man and he would know how to run the country like his business see how successful trump is?
2504,"We created 15,000 jobs but aren’t there billions of people in the world."
2505,Biden needs rest he’s look older than a great grandfather
2506,"What a joke Biden is he will never get my vote , its a shame he is still in office he has no knowledge and a waste to this country"
2507,"Poor man🤔 he needs to step down, or released, from being it&#39;s President."
2508,Praying 🙏 Trump will be the president for another 15 to 20 years
2509,Biden sounds like a nursing home resident. This is sad.
2510,beacuse apollo 11 ???
2511,"Biden looks like hes one of the thunder birds the way he moves and talks ! so go thunder bird Biden walking ,go thunder bird Biden talking! hes a good puppet."
2512,If Lies Are Contiually Repeated And Accepted Over And Over . And No One Is Accountable Then We Will Probably Have A Free For All . Because  Our Protecting Service Men Are Elsewhere And Unaware That The United States And Our Rights Are Under Attack.
2513,We’re doomed.
2514,"Biden is nearly demented, democrats need a new candidate if they intend to win😂"
2515,Both of them don&#39;t deserve to be the president of USA

2519,Trump Trump Trump
2520,"The Democratic party has so many great potential presidential candidates, I get it a lot of them are not old white guys.  But shiet who cares as long as culturally they are American, have honor and strength - combined with Empathy and an ability to join ALL people together.  Then give them a shot to be the leader."
2521,Biden please support the poor people with all the money u spend on war and weapons
2522,I think u guys test those weapons on the innocent
2523,No wonder almost Noone watched this. Biden made little too no sense looking like a corpse. While Trump dodges questions and proclaim to be the best in everything always.<br><br>While both spend 90% of the debate saying how there the best president in history while the other one being the worst In history.<br><br>Bearly memable. It&#39;s just boring at this point. Lies and no progress on anything
2524,"Biden is clearly gone, mentally, physically, I think he will probably be close to death within few <a href=""http://years.to/"">years.To</a> let him even stand is elder abuse, he has very little idea what he is saying and struggles to say it, a few pre rehearsed answers mumbled out. It&#39;s just too clear now that he isn&#39;t fit for duty. A massive mistake for the Dems to let him take part in this debate."
2525,Trump 2024🎉🎉
2526,"America Has To Awaknowlage That The Laws That Were Created Where For American Crimes And Criminals To Making Sure That We Were A Just And Compationate Country , But We Have Been Attacked And Bombarded With So Much Abuse And Criminalities, And Incensitive  Indifference  In Our Own Homeland That We Didn&#39;t  See That These Are Real Terrorism  By The Real Terrorists That Have Silently And Strtigicly Are As A Cancer Eating UP And Devouring Us Along With Our Last Hopes Of Democracy And Life As We Know It.

2535,Bro bidens only face emotions are 😧😏😑
2536,"The American people are brainwashed by the News Media. Americans are like sheep, can&#39;t think for themselves, the media fuels the hate on each side. In my opinion and most of the rest of the world opinion, neither is a good candidate to be President. Onje has reached an age where they can&#39;t think straight and the other might be a little corrupt. 335 million us citizens, is this really the best you have, REALLLY !!!"
2537,Everybody talking down on Biden but I’m asking God to cover him in these times. He’s seen more than we have seen all while trying to carry all of US on his back … for many more years than we realize. <br><br>BIDEN/HARRIS
2538,I noticed Trump doing small nods or shakes of the head when Biden said things. Inside I knew he was like &quot;haha this bozo is flunking this debate&quot; but kept his cool unlike 4 years ago. Smart move agreeing to the rules on Trump&#39;s part.
2539,Bidenomics destroyed my marriage. And I swear she changed after taking the jab of which I did not partake.
2540,Why they wearing gang colors on their ties?
2541,Nah bro cuz when trump was president it was peaceful bro there were no wars

2546,This debate was one of the lowest point in The USA political history...
2547,I love what trump said about if he rigged the system it’d be a lot more nasty than it is he’s right look at what he knows and how he knows
2548,1.15.00 Trump was giving real advice there
2549,"Trump is totally unhinged and literally cannot tell the truth about anything but Biden is losing it and we are worse off by literally every metric since Biden took office.<br><br>Including: Inflation, unemployment including black etc. healthcare costs, drug ODs, crime rate, international instability, US hate crimes, uneven wealth distribution to the 1%, homelessness, housing costs etc. etc. <br><br>It&#39;s going to be a hard decision, both presidents are inept and dangerous for different reasons but the Trump handlers seem to do a better job than the Biden handlers."
2550,I agree Texas has wayyyyyy too many immigrants!!! Not enough jobs or resources especially in the hood . Go talk to your local gas station owner you’ll find out trump isn’t lien !!

2560,Inside jobs deleting files is criminal behavior and activities
2561,"It’s funny Trump making fun of Biden when they around the same age! They are both too old to be running for office it’s just that one is a real dumpster fire more than the other! Biden doesn’t wanna leave power because of all the money he gets from donors, he throws Americans a few policies but Trump is just chaos all through!"
2562,I donot like mr trump&#39;s policy. But mr. Biden is... quite old and weak. Any candidate?
2563,Im laughing hard on biden respone😂
2564,Biden may be old and have his faults but trump is not the answer. Our economy has nothing to do with Biden. When trump left office this country was at rock bottom and it&#39;s not going to get better over night!!!
2565,Comedy gold
2566,Start counting the lies Biden told.  He said his son was killed in Iraq???  His son died of a brain tumor!!!!
2567,CNN lies! MSNBC Lies they all LIE!  Election manipulation and interference to try and stop Trump from running and winning again.  This is so sick!  Biden is demented and should be removed from office!

2572,there is not enough wealth to fix social security. we need Americans to have babies. we could confiscate all the wealth or &quot;make them pay their fair share&quot; (whatever that means) and it wouldn&#39;t be near enough. what is Biden talking about?
2573,Gawing malakas muli ang Estados Unidos ♥️🇵🇭
2574,Biden is so out of it why is he our president

2578,How tf did you prefer this guy over trump.
2579,"Watching from outside America I think voters on both sides should also consider RFK Jr. Maybe an independent is what the people need right now. <br>In the debate he held along side this one, he gave interesting analysis of this debate and layed out some interesting ideas."
2580,These oldies need to retire.
2581,"I don&#39;t even know which fact is more saddening than the other. The first one is that my country (Hungary) keeps electing an idiot for 14 years or the second, where the USA has these two other idiots to chose  :&#39;)"
2582,This is the best stand up comedy I have seen so far
2583,I’ve only watched a few minutes but so far they’re both just saying the other one did something bad with no elaboration
2584,Love how quiet trump is when bidden speaks because trump knows that he will win. it&#39;s an easy win for trump.
2585,"The world is a stage. <br><br>Also, teleprompter much? 👀"
2586,Taxing the rich doesn’t work we need a trickle down from good business
2587,Everyone know republic and democrats have better candidates than them . But they chose this 2 old poor men
2588,The fact these two argued about golf near the end has me dying 😂😂
2589,The dems are playing us
2590,Biden look like a  walking dead.😅
2591,Gotta love bringing your golf game in the middle of your debate.
2592,What a joke. Hard to believe either of these guys are capable of running our country. I couldn’t even finish watching this debate is so bad on both sides. They sound like children.

2604,Remind me how Biden was the most voted for president in U.S history? What are you Americans doing?
2605,Biden keeps saying “if I’m elected I will… blah blah” you HAVE been president and you could be doing all of the things you say NOW and you didn’t 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️
2606,Shortest debate ever.
2607,Yeah they were crazy for leaving these comments open another reason why they didn&#39;t have live people at this one like they did the time before is because they would be cheering Trump on like no other and it would have looked so much worse for the Democratic side
2608,I cannot believe what I just watched. To think that was a debate for the presidency of the greatest nation on earth… scary.
2609,Word of the Night: In History
2610,the look Biden gives to Trump 🤣🤣🤣
2611,we’re cooked
2612,No one fears America anymore because of the back biting happening amongst your leaders. You are slowly loosing your grip on the world America because of choices of leaders you keep giving to the world. Both these guys are Americans but they are not debating issues but attacking themselves. Like an American VS A Muslim.

2616,Trump was right on one thing. Im not even American but Afghanistan was an embarrassment the way the US handled it
2617,Biden is spitting out statistics with incredible accuracy. At his age his train of thought is incredible. Trump is younger but his lack of statistics and facts does show that he is not presidential. Biden when I get to your age I want to be able to spit out statistics as you do.
2618,I&#39;ve watched sleepy Joe say &quot;and the idea that.. ramble ramble ramble&quot;probably 80 times so far and I&#39;m not even halfway through I&#39;ve clocked it

2668,"I am a foreigner and am truly appalled at Biden&#39;s state. He needs to be removed as a candidate and he needs rest. Seeing his reactions , empty sight and slurred speech sounds like he has Alzheimer&#39;s or Dementia. Very poor choice of candidate, Trump truly tore him to pieces. Some people say this debate was fun, i say it was horrifying....."
2669,Вот такие пироги…
2670,"So, you are in a state where you want to destroy yourself, a good man who is true to his word. You must give Iraq weapons to defend yourself, such as tanks, fighter aircraft, anti-tank missile launchers, anti-tank missiles, combat helicopters, and other various weapons.

2695,"I thought that Joe speaks without mistakes only when he is hitting on ten year old girls , that’s impressive Joe, full sentences, most of them, wow"
2696,😢
2697,The US should be ashamed of themselves with a president like Biden. You guys are insane!
2698,"The economy was great with Trump. If a president wants to help medical costs, I would have medical insurance companies compete with prices of coverage,medication prices, and the cost of procedures. This no compete, just charge the max is ridiculous, what other business get the luxury of not competing with out business for you money"
2699,Mr Biden you&#39;re the best
2700,They are just arguing with each other publicly instead of answering and making sure about tackling the problems
2701,Its like eki vs enlil in these groups
2702,"This crazy inflation is due to the combined percentage of Americans and undocumented immigrants who voted for an incompetent, old leader for their own agenda. It is due to their poor choice that most people around the globe are experiencing this crazy inflation. Trump is right; that war wouldn&#39;t have happened if Biden hadn&#39;t won. We wouldn&#39;t be experiencing this BS inflation if the war had never happened in the first place."
2703,"I must say that i really struggled to understand what president Biden was talking about during this debate, and my mom is american, so i got used to hear english a lot while growing up."

2710,Biden has to go!!!
2711,Biden ❌ <br>Bye then ✅
2712,Never knew a corpse could talk
2713,Biden was dementing even before he got in FGS!! Not that Trumps any better with his ramblings and mad ravings.  God help the world with this presidential race.
2714,If you aren&#39;t even competent enough to form sentences you probably shouldn&#39;t be president.
2715,This CNN debate was cunducted in very &quot;fair way&quot; - they treat Biden like the son that need more support. Go Trump!  Cheers From Ireland!
2716,УКОЛ В ЗАДНИЦУ ДЕМЕНЦИИ НЕ ПОМОГ. МЕРТВЕЦА НЕ ВОСКРЕСИТЬ.
2717,Why does Biden look like confused Morty’s mugshot
2718,Trump2024🇺🇲

Who&#39;s gonna wipe my a$$, now??😨"
2729,I make 50K a year far from a millionaire. The only time I got money back on my taxes was when Trump was in office.

2735,hope to anything and everything they vote Trump
2736,"To determine whos the fittest of these two, would be interesting to watch them in a boxing ring🤣😂"
2737,The absence of any UAP related questions here tells me absolutely everything I need to know. 🐑🏴
2738,Muntanga<br>😦
2739,"although biden spoke terrible his poiunts were way better than trump i feel , trump always drifted from question"
2740,Deal with the FARMERS and climate change will be solved!
2741,"Started reading comments before the debate even started. I should say, im really glad i did😂😂😂😂"
2742,"If Trump becomes President and he continues to support Israel then he&#39;s totally out of touch with the peoples of the World. He made a massive blunder the last time he was in office by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The people&#39;s of this World now know they have a weapon and that is BDS Boycott Divest Sanctions and they do not need any Politician or Government permission. It&#39;s already happening and it&#39;s having effect, Shares in all major companies invested in Israel have lost millions of dollars and all this by the actions from the ordinary person on the street. The rest of the World is watching Israel and compare the IDF to the Nazi&#39;s , is Biden the only one not hearing what the Worlds saying. Free Palestine Free the World!"
2743,"It is not just the USA&#39;s economy its a global problem, not point in blaming each other"
2744,"Biden:” Trump is the worst president in American history”<br>Trump:” Biden is the worst president in American history”<br>I don’t who’s the worst between them, but I’m sure the other is the second worst in American history 😂"
2745,My favorite part is when Trump corrects Biden on his golf handicap. How does Trump now more about Biden than Biden himself?
2746,"Hmm, where is Robert Kennedy ?"
2747,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1649"">27:29</a> Biden is thinking, wait, what, we can&#39;t use that lie anymore?"
2748,is biden on botox?
2749,"Pilipino hate bidden... Much better trump to win for president, to stop the issue in WPS., that manipulate by the administration of bidden..."
2750,I cannot Even wait to President trump to be President.
2751,Man they don’t get Obama from under that mask
2752,"Nato the UN and the USA is all one, you would be very ignorant to believe it was anything else.<br>No matter who else is in Nato and UN, the USA pump the most money into this alliance therefore, the USA control all and have the final say."
2753,I cannot even watch this I&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s too pathetic
2754,Manny say that it is a fact that 5G are weapons
2755,but trump trying to keep a straight face was epic 😂
2756,We NEED an independent third party commenting on the facts they disagree on. How is anyone supposed to know who is lying and who is correct without knowing all of the subject matter like this?
2757,And using freedom of speech so what&#39;s wrong with that
2758,Hey I&#39;m only investigating and researching
2759,Are most of all the journalists bought and paid off
2760,Journalist should be asking some different questions
2761,"5 push ups minimum requirement for state house , then Mr Museveni of uganda will be USA president ."
2762,"Remember that time Trump stood in front of a closed down Church called St John&#39;s and he had held up a black book I did not see the word Bible on it but maybe the word was there and I just did not see it, was Trump completing his smackdown on John the New testament was he giving his buddies the green light to go The chabad organization which his advisor his son-in-law belongs to"
2763,"Stop all this pointless debate. If you don&#39;t lie, you ain&#39;t called a politician.. Joe Biden deserves a break from running for president, and Donald Trump deserves another chance in the White House.   Five years is a blink of an eye, and hopefully by then you will have someone proper as your president."

2775,Why you talking about Military Biden we talking about the people in United States and Economy get out biden
2776,Trump: the whole world is blowing up under him!! 🙃
2777,Don’t believe the system is rigged? Do you honestly believe the American people chose these two as their main options for president? <br><br>Bipartisanship is a problem. Campaigns and campaign funding is a problem. We tell our kids that even they could become president. But we know that is a lie.
2778,"I hope President Trump comes to California to Campaign, because I Know He Will Be Well Accepted and Received !<br>And we are thoroughly done with all of the 💩 that the Demoncrats have done to us !!!"
2779,Biden you are the Worst president

2797,"The look on Bidens fizzer when trump said &quot;i don&#39;t know what he said at the end, i don&#39;t think he even knows&quot; 🤣🤣"
2798,Comedy preformed at It&#39;s highest
2799,What’s really going on that Biden’s handlers and the mainstream media now allow citizens to see this —and even leave the comments section open?  <br><br>Something’s afoot.
2800,He may not be a good president but he&#39;s still a human being 😢
2801,What about the economy president Biden? - bad orange man said drink bleach 😮 pathetic.
2802,I used to rag inBiden pretty hard because he&#39;s an embarrassment to this country. What is worse he is nit doing well and they&#39;re still using him. They do mot care about his wellbeing.
2803,"President Biden is talking much too fast in his cadence of speech, while rambling off information, in a low, soft voice, that it is difficult to pick out the facts he is trying to convey. He should have talked slower and louder, emphasizing the facts he was trying to present. Ex-President Trump talked somewhat slower and louder than President Biden, but much of what he relays is subjective speculation and opinion. Respectfully, I don&#39;t think either of them should be running for President."
2804,"I am European and have watched this debate in its entirety. Was Biden really as bad as everyone said after the broadcast? He seems fit to me. Of course, according to his age, but he answered every question, reacted to Trump and got a lot of things right. The one lapse that seemed a bit dodgy was perhaps also due to the excitement associated with old age and exhaustion from his many trips abroad? If you check all the facts from the debate and the arguments raised, Biden won hands down. It&#39;s a shame that, in retrospect, he emerges from this debate as a loser. I hope Americans make a sensible decision in the presidential election for America and the whole world"
2805,"GUYS BELIEVE ME, MR. BIDEN HE MUST LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, WEARING THAT LOVELY SHORT AND ELDERLY T-SHIRT AND ENJOYING THE REST OF HIS LIFE PLAYING GOLF WITH OBAMA. MR. BIDEN NOT CAPABLE TO RUN A SMALL GROCERY SHOP NOT THE USA AND THE WORLD."
2806,&quot;A thousand trillionares in America&quot; 💀
2807,No president has ever said they&#39;d seek retribution because they were doing it anyways. At least he&#39;s warning everyone. But they are having a cat fight
2808,"When TRUMP was the President , there was Peace all around the world. After biden became president , there is war all around the world, peace is lost..."
2809,Trump: Starts Speaking <br>Biden: 😳😧😮
2810,Times to say goodbye for this people 🙏
2811,"&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anyone lie like this guy&quot;<br><br>Pot, meet kettle"
2812,Does anyone else feel like you want to cough really badly when Biden is talking?
2813,"Every time Trump is asked a question, he just goes on some random tangent about something unrelated. <br><br>Every time Biden is asked a question he says - &quot;agsh ruehshu eueu&quot;."
2814,ГОООООЛ
2815,I would love to rewatch this but Joe already made me dumber the first time I watched it.
2816,why did i get this video on search results for &quot;Stand up Comedy&quot; 😂😂😂😂
2817,How did America come from Barack Obama to this??

2819,Is it censored?
2820,"Having watched the entire debate this is my unbiased opinion: Trump was speaking with a lot of confidence and calm demeanor. Meaning either he&#39;s a brilliant liar, or he&#39;s actually being honest. Biden looked confused most of the time, like he was lost in his thoughts. The times he was lucid, he was extremely defensive and aggravated. Trump was speaking in metaphors while Biden was over exaggerating his claims. Trump also had an authoritative tone, like he was openly scolding Biden while Biden really didn&#39;t know what was going on. Whether America is ready for a 2nd Trump Presidency is up for debate (literally), but one thing is for certain, Biden is not fit to have a 2nd term, both physically and mentally."
2821,Nothing but garbage out of trumps mouth
2822,When will bidan quit lying
2823,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=713"">11:53</a> The exact moment that I knew Biden was cooked"
2824,"You are not the most admired country in the world Biden , many people in Europe think that you are the one who‘s destroying the world with all those wars , Inflation etc. People all around the world are struggling day by day to provide for their familys, how dare you talk like you understand and know what it is for familys who do not know how to pay childcare, medicalcare, new pair of shoes for their children, many familys losing their homes because they can’t pay their morgage. It‘s a shame how rich people try to give us their understanding only by words, but no actions. We are not stupid!"

2828,The facial expressions are killing me here in Nairobi Kenya
2829,Hi oh boy Biden makes me sick
2830,The only good thing for Biden here is that he won&#39;t remember any of this in an hour or two.
2831,Gotta love American politics. Greetings from Europe 🤣🤣🤣

2900,"At the beginning you can see the …. Biden is all calm and postured. While mr Trump is somewhat more moved and emotional, even say angry. But this is so false and only a good person knows what’s going on here. See it in a different light compare it with <b>Biden</b> - some sick institutions who kidnap and rpe children and they play good people (see social services in Japan) vs <b>Mr Trump</b> - a person who knows what their true nature is and is burning with anger at what they do but cannot do anything because “law” protects them"

2902,"Why does Biden keep taking credit for what Trump did in his last term? Is anyone going to call him on that? And Biden has NOT raised the Pell grants, I&#39;m a student and receive Pell grants and financial aid! What a LIE!"
2903,"My question is who is planning what is coming to the United States? It’s obvious that something is going down. Consider all the bright minds coming out of the top universities in the world, including Harvard Yale Princeton yet there is not a reasonable candidate running for presidency of the United States. What I saw was a couple of bumbling fools who didn’t even respect each other enough to call each other by their name or title, they ignored questions, they babbled, they both sounded like idiots. Who needs Saturday Night Live? This was reality TV at its best. There is definitely a plan underway and that’s why these two bozos were on the stage. Something is happening, and these two bozos are mere puppets in a much bigger plan that US citizens should be seriously talking about."

I talked to him about it, his dream.” <br>If you vote for trump, you’re voting for a guy who claimed, on national television, that Putin told Trump that his greatest dream in the world is to invade Ukraine. And you would think that if oh, Trump and Putin seem like close buddies if they can talk about goals and ambitions together, perhaps Trump could offer some constructive criticism to Putin’s ideas, especially if Putin respects Trump so much. Obviously this didn’t happen, but if it had then that means they’re just chatting each other up and daydreaming about their ambitions together?? Like either way we’re talking about a guy who lied on national television with the goofiest statement you could make up, or a guy who has evening chats with an evil dictator/war criminal/mass murderer??? We’re so cooked bro"

2989,😮😮😮guess who ?
2990,"In that debate between Biden and Trump, you just ran into a strategy called gish-galloping, where, in a debate, you say many in-factualities faster than all of the other people conducting that debate can fact-check you on all of them before the limited time allotted for that debate runs out. <br>   <br>     If one of the two debaters is willing to use the tactic of &#39;gish-galloping&#39; then the gish-galloper, from the standpoint of a troubling number of bystanders watching, will always rhetorically fully win that debate and any debate. <br><br>     The downside to using gish-galloping to gain rhetorical auto-wins in any debate is that the night after fact-checkers finally finish their rundown of all of the in-factualities told during your gish-gallop, you lose an incredible amount of the trust people had in you, for all people that hear and believe what the fact-checkers have to say about your gish-gallop, for all days after that debate. <br><br>     I hope this pokes some holes in trusting debate results."
2991,I actually feel sorry for Joe Biden it’s hard to watch

All I really heard were two grown men throw slurs at each other . Trump had reasons to cause Biden was wrong on a lot. He said cause it was not true, and the American people knew that but Biden didnt . I feel sorry for Biden because we have known for some time that he has the beginning stages of Dementia . If you had a grandparent or grandparents and Uncle and Aunts with it, you don&#39;t forget the beginning or the end of it .  I hope he gets help for it and in a comfortable place, that is, if his family does the right thing by him 🙏 . You two did a very good job tonight, and we thank you.

3101,Straight to comments .. <br>That&#39;s me
3102,"I like how Trump doesn’t jot don’t notes during the debate. He speaks off the cuff. Some of his stuff is scripted, but most is not. They are just words flowing from his mouth.  They seem so much more genuine than your career politician. His style might be the best, but you can’t argue with the exults against sub-par debaters like Biden."
3103,Biden would play a perfect Mr. Burns from the Simpson 😂😂
3104,Trump rumbled while Brandon mumbled.
3105,Joe Biden is destroying everything good in this country.
3106,"I am apolitical and not a Trump fan so my opinion is based solely on logic.  I feel so sorry for President Biden, but after watching this debate this poor man has/is being exploited.  Trump didn&#39;t need to be on the stage.  CNN could have just asked President Biden the questions, and the outcome would have been the same.  Please give this man some dignity and have him respectfully step down."
3107,"I feel so bad for the Democratic party.😢<br>Dementia took my mother&#39;s life last year. However, her face looked much better, her eyes more aware, and her speech more intelligible than Biden&#39;s. <br>Lord, have mercy upon us all!"
3108,"Biden obviously has Parkinson&#39;s symptoms. We give weapons to Ukraine, not money. 😢 Although Biden sometimes loses his train of thought, Trump doesn&#39;t seem good at logical thinking and tends to only target and blame his competitor."
3109,Biden is so dumb to be world leader 😢😢😢
3110,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=725"">12:05</a> At this point, Trump should have said “I’ll forfeit the rest of my time to let him speak to the American people. Let’s go Brandon!”"

3215,Long live Iran 🇮🇷 ❤
3216,What in the world did I just watch? It was like 2 geriatrics revert to their time in elementary school. Uh uh you suck! No you suck!!
3217,Trump is just beating around the bush and never answers the questions. I can’t understand why the moderators don’t stop him &amp; put him in place.   He’s a narcissist.
3218,"When the USA held back its help because of Trump <br>The death ☠️ toll in Ukraine 🇺🇦 went up the land mass of Ukrainian went down and the time the conflict went up so you can see the tip of leadership that will not work with trump. Just as the mass withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, <br>with people falling from the outside of the plane ✈️ the was evacuating troops from a war against democracy, Taliban<br>That trump ran from because he is a chicken 🐓 and did not hand over the the UN as a defensive but let the Dictatorship rule and rain"
3219,Yooo President Biden seems incompetent
3220,Trump 2024♥️
3221,why is biden wearing a ear piece  he is being coached
3222,I&#39;m having a hard time understanding 80% of Biden&#39;s dialogue.  He sounds like he&#39;s asleep. <br>Nobody saw his condition prior to this debate? Unbelievable !
3223,I really feel for Biden he seems to be in pain🤕
3224,"HOW COULD BIDEN POSSIBLY GET CONFUSED WHILE READING A TELEPROMPTER SCRIPT!? Anybody could follow their head &amp; eye movements (head at 2-3 set points &amp; pupils tracking L-R)! Biden answered nothing. HE. READ!! How come not 1 source points out the stark fact that the “debate” was scripted &amp; READ!? Cuz it makes Joe look even worse!? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23uniparty"">#uniparty</a> 🤥🤡😵‍💫<br>We were tricked into thinking this was a classic spontaneous debate!.. else WHY NO LIVE AUDIENCE!?? 🤔🥴"
3225,YouTube Stop 🛑 delete my comments

3228,Welp we&#39;re screwed
3229,"Ukrainian forces are experiencing big ammunition shortages, as US military aid is stalled<br>The Hungarian prime minister has repeatedly drawn strong criticism from fellow EU leaders for maintaining close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, ever since he launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.<br>Unlike many other Western nations, Mr Orban refuses to send weapons to its neighbour Ukraine, stating repeatedly that Kyiv is unable to win against a nuclear-armed Russia.<br>EU leaders are increasingly concerned that a second Trump presidency would see a significant reduction in US military and financial aid to Ukraine and also the Nato military alliance.<br>A $95bn (£75bn) foreign aid bill - including $60bn in military assistance to Ukraine - has been stalled in US Congress because of Republican opposition.<br>The Republicans - openly encouraged by Mr Trump - say they will not allow the bill to clear the final hurdle in the House of Representatives without first agreeing additional funding for US border security.<br>At a rally last month he told supporters the cash should be loaned rather than given without strings.<br>&quot;They want to give them $60 billion more. Do it this way. Loan them the money. If they can make it, they pay us back.&quot;<br>Russian forces have recently made gains in eastern Ukraine, as Kyiv experiences acute shortages in ammunition.<br>Ukraine is critically dependent on weapons from the US, the main supplier, and other Western allies to keep fighting Russia - a much bigger military force with an abundance of artillery ammunition."
3230,"English is not my mother tounge, but I have no problem with understanding Trump. To hear Biden start with a lie is probably what should be expected. We can all testify that the economy was great under Trump. I don&#39;t know what chaos Biden talks about. If it&#39;s not the chaos he himself has created in Europe and elsewhere, it must be something the old boy dreamt up.<br>🇸🇪❤️🇷🇺✌️"
3231,Why is the MEDIA trying  take more put of the debate than what they have been told by the White House staff. The MEDIA  is harassing the President  and his staff over this debate.
3232,Biden confuses me. babies in cages to boarder control. its time to retire friend.
3233,Biden will win easily.
3234,Worst obama
3235,"I love how the reporters tried so hard to side with Biden and give Trump a hard time just like last time but it failed even worse than it did last time. That being said, both of these guys really do suck."
3236,The debate was a 1.5 hr cheap fake according to the white house as the “far right’ intercepted the broadcast signal and faked the whole event. This has been confirmed by misinformation experts….. never question main stream media….. 😂
3237,biden straight up loses his train of thought 6 sentances deep
3238,All those dead people that voted for Biden should be ashamed.
3239,&quot;There&#39;s never been anything like it... yea sure Donald
3240,"Look Biden, American People want our Freedoms Back. The ones being taking away slowly. I believe more people notice than what you think."
3241,The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea. The idea.
3242,"My question.. Where are the fact checkers? Where are the reports detailing the factuality or fraudulency of all the statements these two made?<br>That&#39;s their job! The press&#39; job is to keep government honest. Every time ANY politician says anything, a reporter should be there to record it, and if what the politician says is false, in any way, in any degree, it is the reporter&#39;s duty to report on that.<br>Where is that?"
3243,More border patrol does not mean turning away folks to Joe it&#39;s faster processing
3244,Donald Trump deserves to win.
3245,My God! Is this guy for real? People need better education!
3246,SLEEPY JOE’S GOTTA GO BUTTON 🔘

3249,This country is a business do you want a CEO with their own money or one who only wants money.<br>Don’t be vindictive when you vote either vote for the best candidate or not at all 🇺🇸
3250,"I have no sympathy for Biden. He’s been a crooked terrible politician his whole life. His comment against MAGA Republicans is extremely insulting. Why would I support someone that has completely alienated half the country? Trump 2024, the people’s president."
3251,CNN - Communist Network New or Corruption New Network
3252,Imagine if Bruce Buffer introduced them
3253,"Biden is half alive. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=690"">11:30</a> he starts off ok and then just trails off into nonsense. Dudes barely awake. Looks at Trump sometimes like he&#39;s a Unicorn just AMAZED. He cannot actually be making actual legal decisions. He can&#39;t even go to the bathroom without help!!!!"
3254,Please let handsome Joe take rests. He is stressful and tired😢
3255,Biden called Trump out of his name.<br>Shameful!  It that’s all he’s got.<br><br>GO PRESIDENT TRUMP!
3256,"He will be covicted when he step out of office,he deals with his 10% <br>,[[ A BIG MAN]],"
3257,Idiocracy is predicative programming
3258,I have never laughed so much as I have in this debate. Trump is asked a question and he never answers it because he&#39;s too busy degrading Biden. what a joke
3259,THEY SAY JOEY WAS LAST SEEN LAYING NAKED BEHIND THE WOOD SHED .....WITH CORNPOP

3276,"I’m not on Trump’s side but at least I can understand half the words he’s saying. Meanwhile, Biden is literally decaying by the second."
3277,Biden&#39;s wife is a horrible person for letting her husband make a fool of himself. Let him rest and enjoy his last years with his family <br> What a horrible horrible wife
3278,Biden has no business being POTUS.  This debate makes it clear that Biden is not mentally sound.
3279,Trump 2024.
3280,Jan 6th set up.
3281,This is hilarious
3282,TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT
3283,"America , having trump again  as the president  mmm I wondering what is going  to be like, lots of insults, more arrogance and  many many locker rooms  talk"
3284,"Америке нужен президент, который прекратит агрессивную политику, а наоборот внесет мир во всем мире. А то слово Америка давно у меня ассоциируется с войной. Где они там война"
3285,Haven’t seen these jobs available. Have seen that just buying a milk it’s no longer 7% it’s 8% now sales tax. Just saying 🙌
3286,"Biden needs to hire a realtor, cause he movin!!😂😂😂😂"
3287,CNN is the greatest antisemitic spreader🤮🤮🤮
3288,"Every time trump is about to speak, ads pop up"
3289,Wow Biden kept calling Trump names. No name calling from Trump
3290,As a normal functional person this is both incredibly funny and absolutely terrifying.
3291,FJB
3292,FJB! It Trump2024 mother flowers

3294,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4345"">1:12:25</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4355"">1:12:35</a> : Nobody wants to screw around with us, jOeBAMA?  Is that why Russian nuclear missile submarines are just off of the Florida coast?  Is that why China is slowly cutting off Taiwan and threatening to invade it?  Isn&#39;t Taiwan one of our allies?  Is that why CCP Warships are cruising really close to Australia - one of our allies, in what is called &quot;sabre-rattlling&quot;?  None of these things happened under President Trumps term in office, compared to you, jOeBAMA!"
3295,Trump bad eno
3296,"Biden can’t focus long enough to complete a thought before bleeding into another and stumbling, conversationally, both coming and going.  The former doesn’t even address his compunction to lie, with every ‘tale’!"
3297,See I like Trump  but I&#39;m from Los Alomos Tijuana and where not all dangerous people
3298,Trump❤❤❤❤🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
3299,When Biden talk about wealthy people effective tax rate shows he doesn’t understand tax system in US. Wealthy people are tax through the businesses they owned that does not reflect in their personal tax.
3300,"&quot;The idea!&quot;.....😂<br>The idea that the last election wasnt rigged in favor of Boe Jiden is the most ludicrous. <br>We must have voter ID requirements and NO mail in ballots unless strict rules are in place.  Handicapped,  elderly, military, etc.<br>The last election was the first in history, where you didnt know the winner the night of the election, and over night it turned into a absolute cluster f**k"
3301,Its like a TV show
3302,The movie &quot;Idiocracy&quot; was way underestimating the degeneration of the U.S. You are done.
3303,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=729"">12:09</a> help😂😂😂😂😂"
3304,That dude Biden is high as gassssss
3305,What is this Americans
3306,"I&#39;m not a republican,  but I like Trump"
3307,The debates usually start in September maybe August. The Democrats set Biden up and now America knows he&#39;s an egg plant running the most powerful nation on earth. They know they have to replace him and they couldn&#39;t wait until September.
3308,i dont think bidens medication kick into 5th gear--i think it went 5th gear in reverse
3309,I&#39;m hunkering down for the Sept 10th second &quot;debate&quot;.  😥😴😱🥳!!!
3310,"Crooked Joe, what about the millions that passed the border, under your administration ?"
3311,Is it me or didn’t they say no note cards or help aids at the podium? Yet Biden had an entire podium full of help aids before he even got to the podium. He probably had the questions with notes ahead of time and still screwed up. This was so one sided. Entertaining yet hard to watch at the same time. And biased too.
3312,They sound like kids arguing. The reporters are more serious
3313,"Golf talk <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4980"">1:23:00</a> you’re welcome."
3314,Trump farted at 116:26ish… I swear!! 😂😂😂
3315,Btden had a cold ?????   Not once did he wipe his nose lol
3316,В Америке вообще есть кто адекватный в кандидаты?
3317,"Biden sure has a strange resting face.<br>This guy should be enjoying his retirement at this stage of his life, not slowly dying in front of the world stage."
3318,"When Dr Jill asks Dementia Joey to come to bed, he blurts out , &quot;I&#39;m coming Hillary, i have to change my diaper first&quot;!"
3319,"OK so I am not from the U.S but at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=625"">10:25</a>, Trump stated that the world is laughing at Americans because off Joe Biden, yea we are laughing at Americans.  But we started laughing when Americans elected trump as president we knew then american is a joke. The joke just continued with Biden. FACTS💯"
3320,The only bright side to come out of one of these two winning will be the south park episode
3321,Its pretty clear which of these two the country needs at this moment in our history.
3322,Trump is our president!
3323,Every time Joe looks dazed and confused they take the camera off him.
3324,Biden is lying
3325,"you can see within the first minute. Joe waves at an empty studio, then looks around for one. it&#39;s over."
3326,Trump was 10000% right with everything he said!!!
3327,Poor Biden. He is really too old to be president now. Such a difference between now and the debate in 2020.
3328,Biden barely knows he’s president.
3329,This man cannot even give A cognitive change unless we wake up to what is really going on.
3330,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=719"">11:59</a> fax coming in"
3331,I don’t think biden knows what’s happening
3332,"from 100 to 120 to usa , but in canada from 100 to 180"
3333,Does he want to go his grave while in office
3334,"Actually i am learning english, but Biden didnt speak in english, why? I didnt get anything from him, But Trump is  clear 🤔"
3335,Oh side track the lie. Joe 13 dead in Afganistán while leaving billions of equipment for ou r enemy’s. JOE IS A LYER.
3336,"I am shocked that CNN was fair for this debate. They have been &quot;Orange Man Bad&quot; for 8 years, now this?"
3337,Close the border
3338,opponent mic will be turn off ..thats explain everything  who and what kind those people are ..
3339,Biden just needed his diaper changed and he would&#39;ve been fine
3340,It&#39;s official. BIDEN IS A BETTER GOLFER THAN 99.5% of the golfers on the planet.  <br>BUT<br>Cannot walk up a set of stairs or ride a bike...<br><br>HES OFFICALLY A REAL LIAR.
3341,"The fact that a lot of these controlled media networks rate Trump one of the worst presidents soley because of the indictment charges and not because of performance in office, tells me a lot about who theyre really working for."
3342,Someone said every time Biden looks at trump he’s seeing him for the first time 🤣☠️☠️☠️
3343,"Between the two, Trump is a far better leader. That&#39;s all I have to say and that Biden acts worse than a child."
3344,The problem is we know now that No Election is fair &amp; honest anymore. Even if we vote...America??...Democracy??
3345,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1176"">19:36</a> he doesn’t even know the terms of the laws he’s trying to pass!!!!! 😂😂 he is brain dead."
3346,With due Respect Biden should be vacation ing enjoying life and not all this stress .this is a toll on him .I hope he doesn&#39;t fall again. This is a lot for him to handle he&#39;s tired.
3347,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=5226"">1:27:06</a> yeah...ok, Tell that to the everdeclining enlistment and retention rates in our military."
3348,biden isnt president the deep state is
3349,We the people stand by Trump we are truly disgraced by Biden
3350,"We all know the numbers, if Biden somehow wins, they will try and overthrow the government, Trump is 100% going to be the next president unless they try and kill him"
3351,A Family of 4 Groceries cost 280.00
3352,We’re proud of you. Former President Trump ❤! Father Almighty’s Blessings be with you forever!
3353,OMG Heaven Help me..........after listening to the whole discussion.........the fact that so many are willing to listen to a 4th grader whine about anything based on nothing and exhort each point baselessly remains remarkable in itself.  Heaven Help us as A Nation if this type of discourse is a recurrent allowance........we are doomed if such is a our current reality.............
3354,WE LOVE TRUMPPP
3355,"Being President of united states of America is the greatest &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;you could be a member of,that means your selfish legacy has been completed 😮because there are only 46 men that can claim that tremendous feat,dead or alive😮"
3356,"I would like to see a list of each candidate&#39;s exagerations and outright untruths.  Like Biden saying no soldiers dies during his term in office.  What about the 13 in Afghanistan,  What about Biden saying he inherited a bad economy.  The numbers say much different.  Biden claims new jobs but those jobs were Covid rebounds."
3357,Average presidential debate: <b>tries to grasp ideas and policies</b><br>This one: <b>tries to grasp words and mouth sounds</b>
3358,Thanks for confirming that RFK is the best candidate in 2024
3359,I&#39;m sorry Groceries are still going up you can&#39;t buy much for 100.00 it&#39;s gone up more then 20 percent...........
3360,The moderators were fair.  The after debate analysis didn&#39;t include allot of spin.   The comments were left open knowing how it was gonna be received..... These jackal&#39;s haven&#39;t been fair or cared about the truth for a decade and a half...... <br><br>You should wonder why they do now
3361,watching from the philippines 😊
3362,TRUMP 2024
3363,What is Biden doing flipping paper.  I thought note were not allowed.  And what about the souind recording that picked up someone communicating with Biden during the debate?
3364,1:15:21 am middle class and I had 10k when trump was president then Biden came and I’m negative 200$
3365,If voting mattered they wouldn&#39;t let us do it......
3366,Biden 86 trump 24
3367,This has to be a comedy skit.  Someone is pulling your leg.
3368,Biden need to go ASAP
3369,Are you sure this not just another Saturday Night Live parody?
3370,Biden is a sad joke.<br>Trump 2024!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

3373,"Trump: they call it border crime, but I call it Biden crime<br>Biden: 😧"
3374,Know if two parents have to work. They shouldn&#39;t have to play with tax credits and things like that they should be able to just bring their children to a child care center and it be paid for by our government after all isn&#39;t it our tax dollars that pay for everything. Yeah that&#39;s a loaded question that ain&#39;t true either taxes do nothing folks but zero out other accounts that have already been opened. When people like the United corporations of America don&#39;t pay their fair share of taxes that&#39;s when it gets hairy. Folks were a Fiat monetary system there is no taxes that literally pay for anything in this country. We simply use taxes to zero out an account somewhere and we create new money every single year and the FEDS spends it into existence. The biggest problem is none of you folks know how to access that money
3375,FREEDOM !!!! Je suis Un!!! On est UN !!!<br>je vous béni !!!!<br>Un pour tous et tous pour UN
3376,It&#39;s not true he is a good man
3377,"Putin&#39;s stance on Ukraine is completely valid. If the sovereignty of his country&#39;s border is threatened by a military presence, every President has the right to intervene. If you disagree, then allow Russia to have military bases in Cuba or Mexico. It&#39;s that simple people."
3378,"Biden, go to sleep, please."
3379,"Well if the people that vote believes that your vote count,that is facts,but if you believe once you vote for a republican or democrat and you control them that is false."
3380,Biden 10%  .Trump 100%
3381,Biden sucks
3382,Remember in the 2020 election Biden mentioned how Trump would act when he loses the election.  Biden says &quot;We&#39;ll see what your #&#39;s are when this election is over&quot; with a facial exclamation..... Get ready the Dems or should I say Socialists are up to no good again.
3383,"the.most.stupid.words.that.have.ever-happened...<br><br>RFK wasn&#39;t invited, THATS SO FUNNY!<br><br>YOuR pOweR Is FalTERinG - yOUr eNd IS Now."
3384,"A war that is funded by the alphabet, selected, and without incrimination state needs to end❣️"
3385,What was the odds on Biden forgetting what he was saying
3386,Biden is driving the world into ww3
3387,"No, biden. That was under obama&#39;s administration about the kids in cages."
3388,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP3D9wKgEkQ&amp;t=2"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP3D9wKgEkQ&amp;t=2s</a>"
3389,Utilizing grammar associated with a 4th grader and utilizing repetition of such as a manner of retoric........Heaven help us.........
3390,What a pity! They could have allowed Biden to sit down at least. He is too old. I don&#39;t think  he felt at ease when standing up for so long minutes. He is tired indeed and this can be noticed through his voice. Trump is still strong despite his being old. America Got incredible Talents.😂
3391,"A 78 year old criminal vs an 81 year old. How are either of these people an option? Its an embarassment to america to be showing this debate when both just need to retire. One has a violent cult following and the other can barely talk. What even is this? Neither should be the leader of our country, we need someone to uphold equality and freedom, without discrimination to anybody, and to defend our countries interests."
3392,😂😂
3393,"now I kinda understand why our clients located in the U.S. mostly in CALI act &amp; react differently every time topic goes to their living, sometimes they vent also in a way when it comes to the billings &amp; expenses. I thought that only our country, the PHIL, is doomed but yours too. So sad😬😑"
3394,were cooked 😔🙏
3395,"Still my question is , who is running <br>The country. ???????????????."
3396,Things have only gotten worse under Biden and Nancy is a roadblock that prevents Trump from having more accomplishments in getting things done. Nancy spent more time with threats of impeachment and road blocking Trump than anything else. Does she even work for the people anymore? or just herself and her vendetta’s against Trump? Her and Biden should both be assessed for competency.
3397,"Still, as senile as he might have sounded......his answers were more conscientiouis each time  than the scandalous remarks made against each argument.........each remark remained self-serving and scandalous without any supporting facts.......I remain scared that so many are willing to take in any part of data provided  by simply put out any scandalous announcements provided................yes, I am still scared.........."
3398,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1507"">25:07</a> I thought he was going to say &quot;I had the highest IQ&quot; 😆"
3399,The first minute of this debate is where the secret service should have run in and surrounded the <br>President and issued a threat warning and that they are taking the president to safety.they may have been <br>Exposed but it would have been netter for him to try and <br>Slide at least one more lie past the people.thank god this ride is almost over . I was gonna be sick if this continues.
3400,Biden 😮 keep opening his mouth Trump keep taking the lead 😂
3401,Joe Biden can barely complete a sentence. Anyone that votes for this is against America. The the the the. That&#39;s all you hear from Biden.
3402,Biden looks evil
3403,I love all people who are vetted legally into our existence.
3404,28.53min.  Biden: I think I know you...
3405,Even though Trump was quite more enthusiastic.
3406,"I&#39;m doing &quot;The Idea&quot; Drinking Game with my favorite coffee, dark choclolate and cinnamon drink!  Oh, Gee!!  I gotta go &quot;Weeeeeeeeeeeeee.....&quot;!"
3407,I think Joe Biden gave nice responses.
3408,"Biden:  Thank you, next person please"
3409,Biden: im zionest <br>Trump: no im zionest more than u you are bad Palestinian XD
3410,Go Biden voting trump could rot in jail
3411,lol.. corrupt af
3412,"Bro, we are cooked."
3413,Let&#39;s get an interview with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. WSJ
3414,Biden really said Skibi
3415,As an Iranian watching from Iran this show was so entertaining and hilarious! 🤣🤣🤣 Trump should be in jail and Biden should be in elderly care center! 🤣🤣🤣
3416,"i am going to say well done to trump. biden is ill and why i say well done  to trump ,is because he kept his cool and didnt say to biden what F@@@ are you talking about"
3417,"Let&#39;s be realistic, this man is over eighty years old and still debates and argues. When my grandfather was his age, he couldn&#39;t even remember his own name. Give this man some credit. Moreover, the position he&#39;s vying for doesn&#39;t require any rational or cognitive level; he is indeed one of the most suitable people for this job. If I were eligible to vote, I would definitely vote for this man."
3418,Im a life long Democrat...and Ill be voting TRUMP!!  He absolite WIPED the FLOOR with BI-DONE!
3419,Biden is the most incompetent president of the US sick man needs to rest
3420,"night night, sleepy."
3421,"And us, as europeans and seeing this debate, just to say one thing, Can we live our lifes in peace, far away from the hands of Washington, for the pity sake??? We have enough troubles with Brussels fake gov and inmigration issues besides a war in our continent, to put up with terrorism destroying Nord Stream 1 and nuke threat because the NATO warmongering against RF...we just want to live in peace, leave us alone, on our own, plz..."
3422,"Have to say I think there are a bunch of losers in this debate. Biden is the biggest loser. Trump is maybe third, I guess some will say he won because he did so much better than Biden, but compared to past presidential debates just a few decades ago he wouldn&#39;t have won. But the second biggest loser is America. I think you can walk down just about any street in America and find a better person to be president than either of them, even if Trump is clearly better than Biden in this debate.<br><br>The only real winner of this thing appears to be CNN. Maybe not perfect but they did seem to do okay. And the fact that this is on youtube with the comments enabled I think is great. Kind of shocks me cause of everyone involved with this they are the only ones that I view significantly better than I did before this debate, and my expectation was that they were going to screw something up by interrupting candidates continually and trying to do fact checks that ended up being incorrect. Only times they seemed to interrupt was when time was up and they treated both candidates the same."
3423,"According to Biden black colleges don&#39;t have money to build &quot;lavatories&quot;.<br><br>This debate is a joke, let&#39;s go Brandon."

3428,I love the music at the beginning 😃
3429,The only scam and grift that I see going on in America is Trump and the Trump organization trying to take down a country that is actually succeeded to be the number one country on the planet. And after his presidency every single other country on this planet saints were a joke not because of Biden but because of this full

3577,Biden is just not making any good points. especially the Iraq war. Biden may have brought the army home but he left all the equipment  we the American people paid for and that gave terrorist more means to cause terror.
3578,This is so hard to watch…
3579,Old people arguing about their handicap and golfing skills🤔

3593,Let’s get ready to mumble!!!
3594,Let&#39;s be real Trump got them on the thing that he hasn&#39;t changed the one thing that brings in too much money the Tariff but let&#39;s be honest if Biden was going to change anything you would have already been done the dude doesn&#39;t even speak to the country he can&#39;t even talk he can&#39;t even talk on his show he&#39;s terrible he&#39;s gone should not even still be in government if anybody has anything to do or change it would be Trump trump has to prove itself and Trump&#39;s two prideful to not do things everybody was against building the wall but everybody wants to say what happened to the wall he fried everybody wanted to build a wall before him and then got against it when he came in office you can&#39;t do things with everyone is against you so I agree Trump needs to get in fire everyone is not on his side with the wall position then cuz you got to have people that are against you but positively but Trump has something to prove and he has to show you that does something so if Trump gets in the presidency and nothing happens that just means no president will ever do anything for us

3605,I wouldn’t be surprised if the actor that plays ‘Crooked Joe’ is on Trump’s side and this whole debate is just an excellent piece of acting of these two gentlemen. I believe the real Biden is not among us anymore. The one we’re looking at now is an actor and he’s doing a phenomenal job. Trump has the whole thing under control.

3619,Honestly not sure who&#39;s worse.
3620,Whats the Vegas odds  Biden will live to the end of another 4 years?
3621,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1774"">29:34</a> Joe Biden says somebody better get him and 2 shadows walk across the screen.. demon activity"
3622,"Key notes : Since Trump&#39;s tax break the debt increased to how much ?<br><br><br>Since the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, the national debt has increased significantly. During Trump&#39;s presidency, the gross national debt grew by approximately $7.8 trillion, from nearly $20 trillion when he took office to almost $27.8 trillion by the time he left."
3623,I love trump
3624,Biden wants rebate
3625,I can&#39;t believe the whiny liberals even let a convicted felon debate against what people call the current president!
3626,"If you put an ice cube in a cup of water, what will happen when the ice melt is some more water in the glass well now it will be the same see level rising 😂😂😂😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3622"">1:00:22</a>"
3627,"And us normal people don’t blame Trump for Covid 🙄 we aren’t dumb okay… Had Biden not mandated vaccines that caused people to quit or get fired from their jobs, some people left their DREAM career because they didn’t want to take the vaccine! BIDENS FAULT!!!"
3628,"The point here is not even how much you don’t like Trump as a candidate, but the fact that Biden is no longer fit to be president."
3629,&quot;The fact of the matter&quot;<br>🤣Biden is a joke
3630,Both are shameful choice for President.
3631,&quot;The idea&quot;<br>How many times did Biden say that..😅😅<br>I can see through all his lies.
3632,Vote Trump 2024👍
3633,This debate is more fun to watch than any other movie
3634,Biden saying trump is the worst president using the internet as reference 😂like ok everything is true here
3635,"Am not even American but I think from this debate, Joe cuts across as someone who lacks accountability and Trump is seemingly the business man here. Joe doesn&#39;t want to maintain eye contact and drifts off point making bogus accusations which leaves Trump on the defence. As far we know globally Trumps policies embraced a peaceful stance and Joe&#39;s current tenure is more about Ukraine and more wars. I kind of relate with Trumps concern that the American geopolitics has become a sham even as Joe sounds delusional when he said nobody wants to mess with America. In reality, the world is getting frustrated with America than ever before 😢😢😢 even as the American dollar is poised to crumble. I think it&#39;s time for Joe to retire from active service. I think he&#39;s simply running because the party doesn&#39;t have a better replacement that can upset Trumps campaign even while knowing the odds, he would just tell himself that at least he did try, after all he&#39;s got nothing lose😢 but American economy will suffer a shock very soon"
3636,Mike Obama can&#39;t be any better!
3637,I always say a businessman is smarter than a politician
3638,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1371"">22:51</a> what’s Quidpro Joe crossing out on his podium?<br>CNN comes to Joe’s rescue by ending his time early by saying “thank you mr president “ when the puppet loses his place.<br>Then we see him crossing out that last answer before the wide angled camera is shut down.<br>That’s why there’s no live audience"
3639,"Its simple Biden is the gay mans/ persons president, Trump is the Heterosexual mans /persons President its that simple so who are you😮"
3640,So who won this debate? Comment below😊
3641,They go to war all around the world and they can&#39;t go to war defending the border that doesn&#39;t make sense to me
3642,TRUMP 2024 🇺🇸
3643,Mr Biden I am sorry your voice is not clear for me
3644,"Don’t worry sleepy Joe, you  are going to still have insurance…. That WE (USA citizens) pay for every time working citizens get paid unless the 18 million immigrants THAT YOU LET IN take those funds - WE pay for their children to be delivered in our hospitals, that’s coming from a registered nurse that works every day. I can’t afford to have a child but these immigrants get free room and board - PAID IN FULL. Only in Joe Biden America"
3645,# 1...# 1...
3646,"Biden, the best the Dems can come up with."
3647,All I know is if Trump wins this election EVERYONE’S CRIMINAL RECORD needs to be cleared! Even this deceased because they were cheated too‼️‼️‼️😂😂😂
3648,CNN She said: Thankyou after she hears something she dont want to hear donald talks about secrets she said thankyou cnn ur so fake ur only trying to make him look bad
3649,"Why didn’t Joe do all those things he said he “could” do when he and his partner in CRIME had the Whitehouse and the country in THEIR stranglehold for eight, long, insufferable years?<br>Ha! All those weeks of practicing his prepared answers AND having his answers written out in jumbo print on his podium was a waste of time…just like his FAKE presidency."
3650,Trump won this. My family in New Jersey and where I now live in Houston TX. We all voting for Trump. We don&#39;t want a weak leader. We have 2 wars and we don&#39;t have time to have a weak minded leader. And we want gas under 2 dollars a gallon again. We have more natural gas in the USA than anywhere in the world. We need to drill and help our people first and help our kids again and get them strong minded. Not weak. Amen 🙏 ❤❤❤
3651,And you grew up where
3652,What about those files you had in your garage Joe Biden I heard no more about that
3653,Is those two are the best American to be a President?
3654,Bye joe. We dont need you&#39;re  so called  politics.  You are for foreign  and not America. American  citizens  at that. Trump is the better president.
3655,Robert Byrd what&#39;s friends with Joe Biden
3656,GOD bless you mr. Trump
3657,"Well lets have a look at What Mr, Trump was left with when he was elected too then ah?😮"
3658,"Biden doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s saying,he&#39;s A very poor leader,he&#39;ll put the country very badly,Trump is very right ,he&#39;s better than all the president,he&#39;s concern for the security and safety of the country."
3659,America can be defined in a single word. What is it?
3660,I get dementia by just hearing him talk.
3661,The Roast of Joe Biden 😂😂😂😂
3662,The debate was entertaining 💀
3663,What is Jo looking at?<br>His PREPARED answers perhaps?<br>The FIRST presidential “debate” where the AMERICAN PEOPLE aren’t in the audience and aren’t allowed to “debate” it where comments are turned off.
3664,The Biden regime has screwed the US that hard that even CNN are looking to bring Trump back 😂
3665,Cnn is holding the debate???? How appropriate. The FAKE president of 2020 best friends. Quid pro China Joe rambles off the answers that he’s practiced for the past month he was in sequestration.<br>Cnn appropriately has NO LIVE audience! Who was Joe waving to?
3666,Trump is the Best 👍
3667,"The idea 😂😂😂 that&#39;s a lie, we find ourselves in a situation  😂 like dude come on"
3668,"I am democrat, but Trump won. I really think that Trump has evolved as a politician."
3669,"SO WHY ARE WE THE AVERAGE, POOR, NOT BEING PAID A LIVING WAGE WITH MULTIPLE JOBS AMERICANS,  BEING TAXED MORE THAN THE PEOPLE AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE ENOUGH TO GET TAXED?<br><br>HOW COME THEY DON&#39;T TELL US ABOUT THE JUGGLING OF LAWS AND RIGHTS IN THE MANY DIFFERENT FICTIONAL JURISDICTIONS OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OH THAT&#39;S RIGHT BECAUSE THAT&#39;S HOW THEY&#39;VE DONE IT THEY JUST PASS THE PROBLEMS BACK AND FORTH LIKE INSURANCE COMPANIES....OH THAT&#39;S A MATTER OF THE STATE NOT THE FEDERAL AND VISE VERSA.<br>We wonder how the rich do it.... and it&#39;s something to do with the many benefits of setting up SPECIALIZED TRUSTS that basically let them get out of being TAXED"
3670,Yo It’s comedy Central
3671,I wish CNN would reveal why RFK Jr wasn&#39;t allowed to the debate in Atlanta ? We the people should be allowed to hear ALL the MAJOR candidates.A constitutional democracy works best when we have more choices.
3672,85billion left behind in afghan
3673,What about the civilians you left behind Biden
3674,"Everyone can argue points for an against either candidate.  The net sum of the day and the last 3.5 years is Americans are worse off in almost every aspect.  Every. Single. American.  maybe with the exception of those who are under full government sponsored aid who haven&#39;t a clue what&#39;s really going on, but the entire world is more unstable, and the American government is the weakest it&#39;s been in many decades.  We are very vulnerable."
3675,Firm believer this man should never been president
3676,VOTE FOR PUTIN
3677,Syntax error Joe Biden..
3678,Biden knows what hes doing and what his party is doing he cant deny it nothing look at that guilty face its a shame
3679,"Trump looks mad, he didn’t even greet the moderators, Biden doesn’t sound healthy at all, it’s concerning, I am not sure at this point!!!"
3680,"Honestly?<br><br>It’s frankly kinda scary that the big media alone managed to hide that the presidente was pretty much senile for THAT long.<br><br>I know, I know, most people kinda had an idea.<br><br>But I don’t think anyone was prepared for it to be THIS bad.<br><br>If they can hide such a monstrous fact in plain sight…<br><br>I worry about the things that aren’t as obvious."

3698,"Chat, am I cooked?"
3699,This debate is edited this is not the full debate!
3700,Biden is the biggest liar even u can see it in his face
3701,"He called in President Trump at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4803"">1:20:03</a>"
3702,Why does it cut so abruptly at the end?
3703,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3704,Trump showed up with so much aura 😮
3705,Yall are the ones w immigrants being here . The republican party.
3706,"biden: The idea of ... number one....alllh bhyu hkkstua<br>trump: I do not understand what he&#39;s talking about, I guess he does not understand either."
3707,There tons of evidence of election fraud
3708,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2767"">46:07</a> in I laughed out loud at this one … “Morals of an alley cat”. 🐈‍⬛ 😂😅"
3709,Senator Byrd was your best buddy Joe. A known supporter of the kkk. You spoke at his wake....
3710,Do you base politics off of someones lifestyle? My lifestyle For instance
3711,Well they&#39;ve made it where you can&#39;t support or vote trump or you&#39;ll be arrested so it does seem like he&#39;s speaking the truth
3712,"If everyone is worried about trump becoming a dictator,then why doesn’t Biden do it now?"
3713,"Trump is a bully, there&#39;s nothing behind him, but as every bully he&#39;s funny and good at talking.<br>Biden instead is the one that should win the elections, but he won&#39;t, because his health doesn&#39;t support him anymore.<br>That&#39;s it.<br>As a European, I think Trump would make a better foreign affair politic, but if I was an American I&#39;d never vote for Trump."
3714,Biden still owes Trump an apology for telling him to shut up on national television at their first debate back in 2020. And my 6 yr old daughter at the time said that . Even she knows what respect is for our President.
3715,"Russia has 4 military warships in CUBA, 1 is a nuclear submarine.  Russia doesn&#39;t care about fighting us.  Biden has made us weak. Private gun ownership is the only thing Russia fears."
3716,Support for Trump from Italy

3725,How can a criminal be America’s president… all indictments found  guilty <br>So many ppl died from covid and trump did nothing  cmon guys   Wake up.
3726,Another comment that was made on a summary/take on the debate in relation to P. Biden. (They did not have a comment section.)<br>I believe it was from the governor of a large west coast state who said basically what party ends their support of a candidate after one poor performance (debate?) To which I say to him and numerous other pundits who act like this debate was this president’s first misstep—where have you been the last year? He has been misstepping all over the place for months… Have you been asleep?
3727,I financially had no issues when trump was in an now i can barely pay my bills... Im going to vote who allows me to afford to live....
3728,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3350"">55:50</a> did he almost let it slip? 😂"

3730,when will we have peace on earth thats my question
3731,America need a younger president.<br>Time to stop Old politics and start the new better ideas for the country
3732,"I&#39;ve seen the poll numbers. If Biden wins, I would have serious questions. Trump is way too high in the polls. But we seriously need to vote Biden out. Enough is enough. Im so sick of his lies. Doesn&#39;t matter what you think of Trump.  Biden is a DISASTER!!!!"
3733,Cornell is still running:p
3734,“He’s 6’5 and only 220 pounds”……. 😙💋😚
3735,"Trump is saying things that Biden never thought he would, so Biden ends up saying too little using too many words😂"
3736,It was easy for him to say.. Its a classic case of J.B.I (JOE BLEW IT) made himself look like a right idiot.
3737,china jo is clueless
3738,Biden called our troops stupid bastards
3739,"Come on try getting it out, try getting it out. I dont know if you&#39;re gonna put this on TV."
3740,So again and I&#39;m a white guy and I&#39;m left out I&#39;m struggling
3741,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2777"">46:17</a> Watch the body language.."
3742,Biden doesn&#39;t even know how to follow along what Trump says.

3746,Couldn&#39;t unsterstand a word from Biden.
3747,"“Lower the price of a kitchen table.” <br>Our current president, 2024"
3748,We were shut down because of covid. Biden created no jobs. We went back to work u goof.
3749,"Joe Biden is a huge joke to this nation! Its very sad, his FAMILY should be charged with ELDER ABUSE!!!!!"
3750,can someone wake up Biden and tell trump to quit mewing
3751,Seriously Joe? Most americans would agree Trimp was a great president and Joe is worst. Just stop with the lies Joe! Just STOP
3752,Biden home direct.
3753,"It is now... this exact moment...when I realized that we need new blood all the way around. All this is just bad and appears to be a fake to me. It&#39;s all a farce it looks like to me. Absolutely ridiculous. We need to get away from this stupid middle school fighting and fix and work on actual issues that are not made up and fake. Let&#39;s talk about fixing the interest rate, let&#39;s talk about immigration issues that will fix the problem, let&#39;s talk about a path to citizenship for illegals, and let&#39;s talk about the slavery now in America rather than talk about the slavery that happened 30 years ago that both parties, especially the democrats, took part in. Let&#39;s live in the here and now and not in the past. Come on guys. Trump, you are better than this. Biden I know is doing his best and it isn&#39;t great. But America needs much much better than both of them. Come on guys....can anyone see this trashy display. We need better."
3754,"JOE IS RIGHT, CORPORATE GREED AND PRICE GAUGUIN IS THE CULPRIT THAT&#39;S DRIVING INFLATION ..... <br>JOE  IS NOT THE ONES WHO IS DEMANDING THE POOR PEOPLE TO REMAIN IN SERVITUDE BY SUCKING EVERY PENNY OUT OF THEIR POCKETS ....."
3755,They mixed up the drugs they accidentally gave Biden the fentanyl instead of the Adderall
3756,Joe don&#39;t be so emotional 😂no one fears or respect America anymore. and how does the worst president only accept $1 payment per year? Trump needs to speak on that.
3757,&quot;My retribution will be success.&quot; - Donald J. Trump
3758,What a bunch of lies Biden.
3759,Hahaha wow. We are going anywhere with these two 😂
3760,Belarus is not apart of nato….. they aided russia in the invasion of ukraine…. Joe doesnt know what hes talking about
3761,Mr. Biden. It&#39;s time to go!!! You are unfit to be president!!!
3762,It’s the only thing Biden does. He’s a threat to the USA. I bet you cry when you lose while the rest are parting. We know of Biden wins we know longer are Americans. We aren’t even free. But we all knows he will because trumps the stronger choice and does what he says
3763,He just said the reason why all these illegal immigrants are coming in to our country. 😅
3764,American democracy? What is that? America is a Republic.
3765,RFK jr roasted them both during his debate. Oh my word was it refreshing to watch
3766,"I&#39;m shocked America has only these two as candidates. Are there no young, capable, intellectual, empathetic leaders in the whole country?"
3767,"No President has ever, destroyed the country like Biden."
3768,If u rewatch the whole video disregarding few pauses Biden done well ...just have low energy

3775,16mil!!! Sheeeeesh
3776,Trump was good and much better than Biden but he doesn’t want to change the subject
3777,I feel the most difficult thing for these two was answering the question that was ask 🤦🏾‍♀️
3778,I still don&#39;t understand what joe is talking about
3779,Gonna stop corporate greed right after the next campaign contribution.  Joe is the worst thing that ever happened to Scranton.

3784,"Here&#39;s the truth! I noticed today that Dow Jones Index has surpassed the 39,000 point mark and Nasdaq Composite Index is approaching 18,000 points, which had never happened before. My money investment has kept going up and up, roughly about 20%. I&#39;m doing nothing except watching my money growing. I am quite happy due to having extra money to remodel my bathroom and buying things I want. Whatever the current administration is doing, is working, and it&#39;s in fact working well. OMG! I cannot believe I just said that. Well, there&#39;s nothing wrong with telling the truth, folks!"

3824,How many times does biden say this is a lie or simply not true........makes me believe some of it did happen ....its crazy the amount of times its said
3825,The duo responded to questions with a lot of humility
3826,BIDEN EL SERVICIO SECRETO ESTA MAS PREOCUPADO QUE TE VAS A CAER A QUE TE DEN  A UN ATENTADO ESTAS MUY VIEJITO LA PRIMERA POTENCIA MUNDIAL QUIERE LA NUEVA GENERACION!!. JUBILATE!!
3827,"Im gonna have to watch this somehwre else on a tv or something . I cant watch this on my phone , i can BARELY HEAR president biden speak . Im in bed sleeping maybe it will help me fall back asleep tho.😅"
3828,Biden doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s even saying 🤣
3829,"Post debate, Jake Tapper had the best idea I’ve heard yet to quell the furore between the Replace-Biden-on-the-ticket and the Keep-Biden-on-the-ticket factions. Hold one or more press conferences where he takes unscripted questions from reporters. It will instantly demonstrate his mental acuity and command over the topics that matter to voters. Not to mention, restore the voters’ flagging confidence in him immediately. My view is that if Biden is asking for my vote, then I as a voter have a right to know this about him.  By the same token, if he hides from voters behind his aides, then please stop asking for my vote. Fair request, right?"
3830,Biden stop  printing MONEY we dont have
3831,TRUMP ESTADOS UNIDOS TAMBIEN HABLA ESPAÑOL @!!
3832,enought of china jo

3836,LOS LATINOS SOMOS CHEATERS TRUMP? Y TU? CUANTOS MILLONES HAS DESFALCADO EN NUEVA YORK ESO  NO ES CHEATING?
3837,"Hear me on this … this is not a rally for your High School football team, this is a choice for the man who will run the most powerful nuclear  country in the world.  Your vote will determine that, and you have to make the RIGHT choice for the best person for that office, for our country, not just because it’s your political party.  We need a leader who is alert and cognitive.  The sad thing is that the Democratic Party has no one else to run for president?  I wonder why? - Pappy"
3838,Did you see Biden fiddle with his right ear? Ear piece is bothering him.
3839,"Biden has a brand new word,, idea,,"
3840,Im not rich but when TRUMP was in i was not suffering and it was covid times as well

3843,Biden was dozing off for a minute.
3844,"And I still say this who would still vote for Biden, he doesnt make any sense when he speaks and i thought W Bush was out of it."
3845,wow......99% of the time biden was incoherent.  I can&#39;t believe jill...or the democratic party  for allowing  this man to be in office this long....think of it.....we are on the verge of  bankruptcy and nuclear war....and we can thank the democratic party....
3846,comment of a german: US became a subject of laughter when Trump started his very presidentship.
3847,Biden loves gaslighting americans do your own research facts don&#39;t care feelings. Curiosity question why couldn&#39;t we get trump vs. Robert Kennedy?
3848,Joe Biden  still strong...
3849,Funny how the people announcing things at the start were more professional than the president and former president. They did absolutely nothing. Nothing was accomplished. Neither should be in office
3850,this is the best thing comedy central ever posted!
3851,This is bad
3852,POV: You do not live in America and find this Entertainment 💀

3856,"Trump is right, if they continue this way. America will be 3rd world. Look at South Africa. You will have a comunist country run by criminals, stealing all the money."
3857,Biden is the reason we dont take anything americans say seriously🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3858,So these are the two people running for president…<br>Americans: 😔<br>Foreigners: 😆<br>North Korea: 😏

3864,By by Biden. Hello Trump. Thank God!!!
3865,I&#39;m not even american and I don&#39;t need to watch the whole 1 and a half hour thing to know that Trump is wining the elections...Like just look at them...
3866,It is like listening to stand-up comedy when Biden speaks! So unreal to think that this grandpa from a nursing home is president of the most powerful country in the world.
3867,I think Hillary Clinton had more chance than Joe Biden
3868,Brondon where you at?
3869,cheaters never prosper. this was so rigged to help biden. and backfired perfectly. gotta love it. and ya nice try with those weak cheats trying to help biden.. when he stumbles tell him thank you real fast move on ect ect. its easy to see in this video. the bad thing most americans probably missed most of it. but if you missed it look for jump cuts and the hosts thanks you and quickly moving on ect. proving it was rigged to help biden. but the best part as we all know. there was no saving him from himself.
3870,"It was a bad night for Biden, but I still love the integrity of Biden.  Both candidates are not fit for such a great nation.  Age and dishonest kk"
3871,Jesus is King

3886,Trump always angry with immigrant. Hope he will not win the presidency again
3887,biden is a genius president
3888,Biden sounds like a kid in trouble at school
3889,Stop giving loans to Pakistan .spent money on American poor people
3890,"Yo pienso que si los Democratas quieren frenar a Donald Trump presenten un candidato de verdad alguien digno que le compita a Trump y no Biden, ese señor que parece que anda penando en la casa blanca, de verdad que los democratas se pongan serios y terminen el show, que el señor Biden se vaya para la casa de reposo, como los democratas no van a tener otro candidato que si este capacitado para competir el cargo mas importante de EE.UU."
3891,Pair of liars? Probably. I say this though. In light of what you seen here. Could you say with 100% conviction that Biden is running the country? That&#39;s a massive Elephant in the room.
3892,“Black jobs” huh.… what is a “black job” that statement is triggering to me.
3893,"Lowkey I feel bad for Biden tho, he’s clearly a tired puppet"

3901,I&#39;m here on the 5th of July 2024; Biden always walks like a robot with zombie moves. The old man should be home receiving home care.

3924,Who&#39;s hear to watch bidens mouth agap
3925,BIDEN got schooled
3926,"Trump took an oath to protect the constitution. He has done nothingbut tearing it down, also laughing at ot our judicial system  Every bad remark trump makes againt Biden, trump, he is guilty"
3927,How embarrassing
3928,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4073"">1:07:53</a>.... Thank you president Biden, President Trump?  lol"
3929,Take a shot every time Biden says &quot;the idea&quot;
3930,We finally beat medicare😂😂😂😂
3931,"Biden is old, guys. Please bear with him, number 1.  Number 2, his smile is so addictive 😂"
3932,"Did he call Biden, Brandon ??? About endorsement y of border patrol?"
3933,"I watched every minute that sedious act to our capital. He watched it on tv for 3 hours before he finally told his people ,friends to go home . He said we love you to these people who killed guardsmen who tried to protect our senate the transfer of power"
3934,TRUMP 24
3935,please stop Bullying president Biden

3937,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=709"">11:49</a> yes i think elder care is really important, he should be taken care of"
3938,My prediction is the Democrats within 3 months of Joe Biden being re-elected (if he is) will themselves deem him unfit for office and let Kamala Harris take the office.
3939,UFC should set a match for them 😂😂
3940,Why did Obama throw Bin Laden out the plane
3941,By the way tarrifs are paid by the people. Tarrifs raise prices.
3942,Joe Biden just told her a big fat lie
3943,I am the witness of 2 old men
3944,What a joke.
3945,Biden looks too old....c´mon guys...he barely speaks....
3946,"You would just hand over Ukraine to Russia. You tried to stop payments to Ukraine unless the found diet in Bide . Frump is a kiar a traitor, liver if Russia ."
3947,"Well, at least Trump try keep his compose to a minimum responses, and Biden did not fall asleep on his debate. <br><br>Still no to both."
3948,Putin invaded the criemea Ukraine. Before Biden wS president .Trump allowed this when he was president.
3949,Why would any American vote for Biden again .. this is insane
3950,Trump never just answers a question....good grief he answers things that haven&#39;t been asked yet....he talks in circles...Trump said biden wants to take the baby in the 9th month....he lie like a rug
3951,Trumps  lies are astounding. I have video when he said those horrible words against our vets.
3952,"Lots of intelligent &amp; funny comments here… I struggle in amazement at the elder abuse of our current president. I am not a fan of most of his political stances, but I will always be for respecting the highest office in our great country. Pure &amp; simple, IMO, P. Biden is being &amp; has been used to facilitate influence and control in our government. He is seldom, if ever, completely lucid. He should have an advocate-preferably, a family member (ding ding wife), who says that’s enough. (Like a least a year ago) At least his presidential legacy could have been in part, one that ended early but with dignity. It is painful to watch his continued diminishing state on stage for all the world to see. It is like watching an episode of The Twilight Zone when realizing he is The President of the United States of America &amp; is on display as he lives out his aging process under extreme pressure physically and emotionally. Shame on everyone who has continued to use this once vibrant human being in this way."
3953,You Biden are the only so called President that didn’t make sense or your mumbling when you can’t remember what  to say! <br>Go Trump!❤
3954,"Trump is Trump, but Biden is unfit."
3955,"Maga directed by Trump refused to pass a bipartisan law for the border immigration but he trump told them NO  So they did not pass the law why, because he did not want Biden to win."
3956,It is scary anyone believes a word Biden says. We are living through this Biden administration we KNOW!
3957,These cannot be the candidates to run the most progressive empire in the world.
3958,Biden has to go NOW.  Trump is what we need NOW. Im for Trump ALWAYS.
3959,"It’s awful these are the only options for Americans. Both are delulu. Tons of immigrants came from former Soviet Union countries, highly educated people, definitely not criminals. But yes they were given handouts when previously immigrants had to work really hard. They had free child care while I’m having to pay for it all and pay more than rent for 1 child. They haven’t answered the single question. Just blah blah. And wake up people. Understand that they are both on the same side. They are both supported by same elite. And then it’s all of us on another side. Never never I would have believe I would rather support anarchy than something like this. This is absolutely awful and painful. America has become a joke, nothing is better than in other countries. Have you been to Asia? Northern Europe? The only reason America is still standing is because of the very very hardworking Americans. Despite the government. Not because of the government. How sad. (Btw I was not born in the US I came legally 12 years ago, I was proud of American values, and then so disappointed to see what’s happening). I’m hurting for the people. And I’m hurting for the world. Because world depends on the US and depends on the dollar. I can’t believe as people we cannot do anything to stop this"
3960,"...Gump never answers any of the questions he&#39;s asked and sleepy Joe is to old to last another term. Neither of them deserve to be President, they think that their golf game should determine how healthy they are OMG really?"
3961,Vote for the lesser bad
3962,"Man, a Biden vs. Trump debate in 2024 would really be something! Their styles and policies couldn&#39;t be more different. Just picture the sparks flying it&#39;d easily be one of the most anticipated debates in recent memory."
3963,"Dude, Biden can’t even finish a sentence"
3964,"Mr Trump said put bleach under your arm, you’ll be alright. 😂"
3965,And these two are the ones who always shout democracies to the world 😂<br>Yup your country is doomed.
3966,Trump got rid of 1500 safe guards for you the people. Now railri can freight chemicals through towns. If acciend occurs luke ine did the railroads are claiming no responsibility to clean up the mess they created
3967,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2036"">33:56</a> when you realize you have 1hr left of debate 😂😂😂 This is elderly abuse for Biden"
3968,It&#39;s like listening to a drunk person after 55 shots of vodka.
3969,"The man, Trump, knows economics!"
3970,America has fallen. We in europe laugh at america now becaise of biden though him america is a joke
3971,Trump handled the country much better than anybody else would have during the pandemic. There was world peace when Trump was President. Just like Trump mentioned in his debate Russia would never have attacked Ukraine and Hamas &gt;Israel if Trump was in power. Trump wouldn’t let it happen
3972,I am terrified for nation!!!! poor leadership from both. Trump is disgusting!!! He cares for no one but himself and dangerous to society. He is not to be trusted.  People had better use wisdom!
3973,Trump2024
3974,That is because trump has no leadership  He is ready to pass the buck to the states. He knows how to play golf.  He cheats at that too.
3975,Biden performed so well and literally whooped orange man in every subject. Awesome job BIDEN!!!
3976,2024 trump has my vote on 2 reasons border crisis &amp; inflation crisis.
3977,Two grandpas exposing their dirty laundry&#39;s to the entire world. What a shame to America the great country 😂😂😂😂😂😂
3978,Trump is right inflation is killing us! Everything is way to expensive. We were so much better off with Trump.
3979,Businessman is smarter than a politician
3980,I am surprised that presidents talk about blacks /hispanic and what not.. it has to be citizens.. only one word AMERICAN. They all are equal.. I just did not like that part.
3981,The idea is ok.
3982,All t<br>you get with Trump is chaos. And lies.
3983,This proves there is no god
3984,"Trump isa joke. He left so mush damage and yet, Biden came in and brought America back"
3985,Biden is old he doesn&#39;t even finishes a sentence without shattering
3986,Trump 2024
3987,"Trump killed 100,000 and more he killed americans because he was not a leader."
3988,Trump es más diplomático.
3989,Bide. Was great! He answered<br><br> the question Trump lied and lied .
3990,"Compared to most African leaders, Biden is still Great"
3991,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2766"">46:06</a><br><br>I’m not on either side, but why the heck is he giving this guy more time? Clear bias by CNN.<br><br>Not that I’m surprised of course."
3992,"All what I hear is that Putin is a war criminal :-D I see only war criminals on Western side, European, USA, IsraHell ... the United States will go down, it is gonna happen in this year - I dont support the wat in Ukraine at all. Peace could have established in April 2022 but the US and the UK didnt want it. They wanted to continue the senseless war"
3993,Please no one support!
3994,Right
3995,France chodzę now
3996,"Biden whit face of where im I every debate. So LOL <br>GO TRUMP, MAKE AMERICAS GREAT AGAIN 🦅"
3997,Its awesome
3998,Biden is a joke!!!! I’m ashamed of him
3999,Oh my goodness. I cant believe these two bozos are our canidates. They are sitting there arguing like children. I am genuinely scared for our country
4000,I live it
4001,"It’s true everything that comes out of that old man’s mouth is a lie. God God bless you, Mr. Trump."
4002,So why we still paying sub charges when going to doctor ? Why we still paying for meds
4003,Biden starts a sentence and finishes the sentences he started 10 years ago
4004,"&#39;WE CALL IT MIGRANT CRIMES, BUT I CALL IT BIDEN MIGRANT CRIME.&#39; DONALD TRUMP, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE😂😂😂....I LIKE THIS MA SHAME!!!"
4005,"With Trump, no body has ever, seen, heard, done, or been before.  With Trump, he is the first, the only, the most, the best anyone has ever been before.  With Trump, he will always been incredible...well...at least he got that right.  I&#39;m not giving him a second chance at making America great again.  He didn&#39;t finish the Wall....a lot of money wasted that Mexico never paid for.  And that is just one thing he didn&#39;t do that  he said is causing America&#39;s downfall.  Without all those immigrants, his properties would have never been built.  Ask him how many immigrant maids provided him services, like changing the sheets after encounters with women like Stormy Daniels."
4006,Bs the cost of groceries has went up way more that 20$
4007,I wish trump had a real opponent
4008,"BIDEN, we are quickly becoming a failing country, record Homelesnesssssssss leads to record CRIME!"
4009,Go TRUMP!
4010,78 and 81 years old 😮 We can do better than this.
4011,"I just want to say how terribly sad this is 😢 This is an elderly man’s so many people are making fun of! I blame his family and colleagues,President Biden health is failing and know body close to him will do the right thing 😢i would never allow this if it was my Dad 😢"
4012,Rip America 1776 - 2024
4013,They should do another Saturday night live of this debate 😂
4014,Listening to Biden hurts my head
4015,When biden speaks <br>Trump : 😕<br>When trump speaks <br>Joe biden : 😮😧
4016,"I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;ve seen 90 year olds with full-blown dementia speak better than our president, did you people really vote for him ,and are going to again? I beg you for the sake of our country please don&#39;t!!"
4017,"Biden always talks about 15m jobs he created, but they just gone during the pandemic, as everywhere in the world. No achievement"
4018,Before the debate even started the moderator said that NO NOTES WOULD BE ALLOWED. At around 36 minutes Biden held up a pad of paper and folded over the page. Then at 38 minutes he once again held up the notepad. You could notice all through the debate Biden was looking down most of the time at his notes. HOW COME THE NOTES WERE ALLOWED BY HIM???
4019,Worst debate ever
4020,They&#39;re just like children fighting. They left the question and fight against who&#39;s the better president.
4021,Joe Biden has a gay administration
4022,"Dear HUMANS, Biden doesn’t talk like this…<br><br>…notice his speed, loss of speed, speed, slower speed, etc…<br><br>Why…?<br><br>Because he’s reiterating what he is hearing within his earpiece. <br><br>…like …a ROBOT!"
4023,Why couldn’t Biden make his own case for Trumps presidency? He refers to unnamed “experts” that voted him the worst. What am I supposed to do with that?
4024,Red and blue have got to go. What a SHAME.
4025,"I think the last 3 minutes should be a face off on who has the best dad jokes. <br><br>I mean, it’s already borderline comedy may as well give it a cherry"
4026,I love Putin whole world love Putin he is world leader
4027,Trump is very sharp as always. Biden appears to be lost in the air.
4028,"Trump “ooh he’s right,he beat Medicare,he beat it to death” best thing I’ve heard 😂"
4029,"The amount of time Biden said “ the fact is” dude you have been debunked that many times 🤦‍♂️ trump is right,  iam 39 from Australia, these few years Biden in office have been the only time I felt Australia was stronger  then the USA."
4030,The only thing no one can debate is how much debt the US is in and how it is dispersed world wide by the dollar which is the reason countries are ditching the dollar and reclaiming their gold.
4031,"Look at this debate, we need a age limit.we are in a world of trouble. If we can’t get anyone in there to fix this country we are doomed. Don’t know if Biden is capable to fixing it he’s more into destroying our country, Trump maybe fix it but we are still in the process of losing our country. We are in deep crisis"
4032,I support you Donald
4033,Looks like Joe Biden going to bite the dust
4034,It’s almost a debate lol
4035,Biden cannot even say a sentence clearly and still wants to be president. It&#39;s pathetic
4036,This is the most biased debate I have ever seen. The moderator spends more time talking on behalf of Biden than the participants.
4037,"America, you are stronger than some terrorist corrupting your society. You guys have taught your ideas all over the world. The entire world is America, because America is  an idea,not luxurious houses and cars. <br>You have a home all over the world; not only in America.<br>Love you brothers and sisters; love from Nepal.🫡<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23immigration"">#immigration</a> is a policy to liberate whole world; you know the idea by living it."
4038,Sorry America.
4039,Biden is a liar
4040,"&quot;He&quot; &quot;Number 1, Number 2&quot; &quot;By the way&quot; &quot; The idea&quot;???? Do these guys not know how to articulate sentences? They CAN&#39;T be speaking like that.<br>If this keeps going like this Americans will start expecting to see whales with arms and legs and coming out of the ocean given the fact that everything mixes in in the US."
4041,"LoL &quot;no one wants to screw around with us&quot; - that&#39;s why Russian Navy is in Cuba and USA didn&#39;t even react 😂😂😂 &quot;everyone admire USA&quot; YEAH SURE, we&#39;re the embarrassment of the modern world"
4042,Trump is bad but biden is even worse😂
4043,Conservative media has been showing this hospice patient but state run media has been hiding his dementia
4044,Purge Election year is coming .4th of July purge Happy independence day. Lol
4045,Biden doesn&#39;t even know what he says himself!!!!<br>He can barely talk it seems he cant breathe 😂
4046,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1345"">22:25</a> Trump calls Biden - “Brandon” I almost lost it 😂"
4047,What makes 2024 looks like 1950s on the screen.
4048,Where&#39;s my student loan forgiveness Biden that you promised
4049,Why want USA that other countries are afrait of them?
4050,"Biden, this is a complete lie. I am from Portland, Oregon and I can tell you 1000% that the police force there has decimated so much that you can go an entire week without seeing them. People are going 85 miles an hour up-and-down I five because there’s no police force anymore and that is because of you and the Democratic Party on the West Coast was making it to where police if things go wrong. They are guilty before innocent that was you that had nothing to do with Trump. 😡"
4051,Beware of trump idolatry Stand for the truth and don’t be biased Jesus is lord
4052,"I live outside the US, i.e., part of that world that he says respected us when he was President. No, they didn&#39;t - and they will not respect us if he is re-elected."
4053,Impeach Biden please.
4054,"Personality is one of the hardest things to change so past behavior is a refection of what they&#39;ll do. Trump will try to remove more of your rights, remove social security, remove medicaid and medicare and social security, increase taxes for the poor while lowering for the rich and his buddies and their companies, fraud against people taxes just like he did with the banks and loans for his real estate inheritance, and sell out people and their money against other countries. I don&#39;t know why Trump isn&#39;t locked up for treason for supporting Putin against Ukraine, and Putin probably has some blackmail dirt on him and can no longer make an oath for the constitution as president. In addition saying that he doesn&#39;t care about NATO and the insurrection attempt on January 6th. Those supreme court justices down playing the crimes and trying to give him immunity shows their corruption and treason and need an investigation."
4055,Those election 2920 is in wuestion?
4056,Why is Biden not impeached and he and his party not charged with treason?  Theres something terribly broken in the system.  What about the oath they took. They seem to ne anti American. Just my opinion..  proud to be a true American patriot
4057,Mark Robinson for VP

4068,"No to both, need new to move forward."
4069,Upsetting that RFK couldn’t be in the debate
4070,Biden looks like he&#39;s learning things every time trump talks. Maybe we should have a debate every week until the election so that biden can learn how to run the country a little better till trump gets in
4071,"Had to forward when biden was talking, since i could not understand what he is saying.<br>He is sick and needs help. This inidcates a group of people non elected has been ruling america,<br>since this man is sick. Trump is not good either, but at least he is not sick."
4072,"Honestly I feel so bad for Biden. Aside from his obvious disability, he just doesn&#39;t have the rhetorical skills to match up with whatever Trump was accusing him of. I&#39;m sure he had a good or at least a fair point answering all of these questions, but it sometimes just landed as &quot;jfhdwiudhsufhs&quot;."
4073,Score cards:<br><br>Trump: 8/10<br><br>Biden:   6/10

4102,Its like watching 7 year olds stumble through a group debate for the first time. The words said in this make me feel like im in primary school (5- 11 year old)
4103,Is this real to actual today? Im not an American so im confused isnt trump a felon? Isnt he in custody and not allowed to speak like anything in this manner? Regardless

4130,Have you fired anybody before Joe? <br>Joe: 😟

4132,バイデンさん、、、もう休んでくれ、、、
4133,Trump is are president

4135,Drinking game: ever time Biden says “idea” take a shot <br>You’ll be drunk before you know it!!
4136,Joe answered all the questions and he knew all the fact - now he get chocolate chip ice cream
4137,"Everyone has their faults and weaknesses, along with our government needing improvement. Which candidate has filed bankruptcy Multiple times and broke contracts with small businesses after work was completed?  Who is always right with everyone else being Wrong?  Which one takes responsibility for their own mistakes?  Who has had more comments proven wrong by fact checkers?  Who has fired everyone around him and showed no respect for others?  Think about which one has had more of their associates being charged with crimes and going to jail?"
4138,I was going to take a shot with every &quot;the idea&quot; but couldn&#39;t afford it
4139,WOW 15000 NEW JOBS??? IN A COUNTRY OF 360 MILLION??? WOW I BET YOU&#39;RE SO PROUD!!

4145,"I think the rich need tax cuts. Why? It brings money back to America, if our bosses get tax cuts they can pay and hire more. So the business down the street that once had tax cuts now has to close and fire everybody because they can&#39;t afford to pay people because taxes are so high. That&#39;s basic economics."
4146,Joe Biden should apologize to Americans for running for President.
4147,A 100 doll basket of groceries is now 200.. and I live in small town.
4148,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1285"">21:25</a> who loves this scene?"

4150,Notice how Biden squints his eyes to read the scripts. It’s like he’s not even there he’s just saying what he sees.
4151,Biden and the democrats lost this won... watch the end when Biden leaves the stage... he side steps down the stairs. 😂😂😂
4152,James Buchanan is the#1 worst president in the USA
4153,He keeps saying idea but did he even try to find out why they attacked the white house on Jan.6. If he went and actually try to work and find out he would have known

4164,President Trump Debates To President AI/Robot 😂
4165,The Biden&#39;s ought to be ashamed of themselves for letting Joe go out there and look like a walking corpse. It was painful to see him struggling like that the whole time.
4166,Too big to rig.
4167,TRUMP 2024
4168,Oh god. These people wicked to biden. Yall dont realize the man is hardly breathing. Wow
4169,This is all theater.. what a joke
4170,Who is ruling america???
4171,"I really think Biden believes all what he is saying, because that is what his handlers told him. Everyone who is watching American &quot;news&quot; knows that Trump is correct when he says America is a failing country, it is no secret - Biden is the only one in the world who believes otherwise. On top of that ignorance, he is the biggest liar of them all!"
4172,"Poor Biden. His wife is mean for letting him get on stage and making a fool of himself like that. He&#39;s obviously dealing mental and health issues. I just seen an article that stated the reason he was so off is because he does better between 10am and 4pm. If anyone has dealt with the elderly, that called Alzheimers and or dementia.  Stop torturing Biden and put Trump back in office.  That&#39;s who should have been in office this whole time!!!! TRUMP!!!!!🎉"
4173,No. One and no. Two 😅
4174,"Biden looks frightened and needs to be taken to bed, its obvious hes not fit to be running a country and should retire and rest, he is just a face with paper and instructions, he wouldnt be able to do this debate without his ear piece telling him what to say"
4175,If these aren&#39;t robot&#39;s then idk what they are. There&#39;s no way people like this exist.
4176,Joe Biden unluckily is too old...he seems to be so weak...his voice is only one sign for this weakness...Trump is rhetorically excellent.... nevertheless he is a liar..🎉🎉🎉
4177,They want you to pay 6% of your paycheck for social security. Meanwhile they selling billions of dollars to Ukraine. These guys are nuts
4178,He speaks like a Robot glitching.😅
4179,orange man GOOD
4180,is this even real
4181,I love how these are the only 2 options 😂😂😂😂😂
4182,Biden speaks like a robot lol
4183,I feel embarrassed after listening to Biden
4184,They held this debate before the parties officially choose their candidates for a reason. This wasn&#39;t a debate; this was the puppet master making the puppet walk the plank. Now all democrats see what republicans already knew. This gives the DNC an opportunity to switch Biden with someone with higher brain power and arms that are more posable than a lego. I really hope whoever they might pick is further left than Biden.
4185,"To non Americans insisting on Biden to be their Democratic candidate, is mind boggling. Is there no one else?"
4186,I&#39;m trying my best to understand what Biden is saying 😂
4187,The main thing is that both of them standing straight for 1 hour 😅
4188,Biden should step aside.
4189,Trump is a scammer

4214,"Biden has that 100 yr old gasp when talking… it’s almost like his meds are wearing off. Then he brought up sex with a porn star in the debate 🤭 “I don’t know what he’s talking about, I don’t even think he knows what he’s talking about” (Trump)😂😂😂"
4215,Trump: Says literally anything.<br><br>Biden: The idea! 😒

4217,Biden looks lost and confused <br>Trump looks determined.<br><br>I just can&#39;t trust someone to work and lead this country out of the gutter who can&#39;t even work his way through a sentence.
4218,"Let me just say, as an Australian, that was very entertaining. 😁"
4219,A couple dusty old queefs in my opinion
4220,Immigrants that were allowed to cross the border were given Medicaid with fertiity benefits. I am so sad for our country. We should not have to work 2 jobs with a college degree just to keep our bills paid. Living paycheck to paycheck.
4221,Biden&#39;s bits are probably impossible to subtitle.
4222,America is doomed.
4223,Can anyone explain to me why the US thinks it’s a great thing to support Israel?
4224,Why aren&#39;t either of them answering any of the questions they&#39;re asked😭😭

4226,Trump: nobody likes him I personally despise him everyone hates him.<br>Biden: you’re a liar pants on fire
4227,Facts Trump. TRUMP DID SOME GREAT THINGS
4228,Its like Donald Trump debating Ozzy Osbourne
4229,"Biden Is The Worst American President Ever ,, He had no . match on Donald Trump ,,,, Trump did what he thinks the best for american....."
4230,Nice speech! Love from China^ ^
4231,Wow  I can&#39;t believe that the current President really is standing there trying to say that he has done anything even close to what President Trump had done for the American citizens. As soon as Biden took over gas prices started going up and everything else through our great country also. Jobs became harder to find. Truth is jobs were so much more plentiful.
4232,"Having watched the full debate, I believe Biden is simply too old for this role. He doesn&#39;t seem fit and his performance was quite concerning. I was surprised he could stand for that long, to be honest. In contrast, I think Trump can do a better job and we need someone like him in office."
4233,I wonder what happens if Eckhart  Tolle becomes the president of the US 🤔

4241,And it&#39;s very sad I don&#39;t like both parties but it&#39;s very clear Biden team got trump convicted cuz they are scared he will become president. How unfair and dirty is American politics. We are savage and I&#39;m embarrassed to be living in the USA I&#39;m actually researching places to retire in the future. America is not land of the free we will still pay lots money even after we retire. No ease of life..<br><br>Tbh it only makes me want to vote for Trump more now that he is convicted just to say FU to the baby boomers Democrat destroying our beautiful country. I&#39;m not team Republican or Democrat I&#39;m team me and the public opinion.<br><br>I base my choice on how I live daily. When Trump was president everything did seem more calm in the world. Prices were lower and taxes steady not to much hardcore war. Biden president food prices gone up. I have nothing against immigrants but they&#39;re are seen to be to much of them coming in rapidly. We can barely take care of our citizens let alone rapidly welcoming immigrants to come in another mouth to help n feed. Biden president so many chaos and war happening around the world as of 2024. It&#39;s crazy how it definitely feels like the Democrats Biden team are getting richer and I&#39;m an average middle class trying not to be in the poor zone. Even if I&#39;m poor I might be better off cuz then I can get free government cheese like how Obama Hilary Biden likes to support section 8 people.... Which is not fair for hard working middle class like me who don&#39;t qualify for those benefits

4250,"That&#39;s actually a pretty good system, a fair coin toss to decide positions, no audience, and microphones muted between answers.<br>Here in the UK, its a sham, we get a bias channel who conveniently decides the positioning, who allows the two main leaders to talk over each other and achieve nothing and a hand-picked totally one-sided audience! 😢"

4254,Who is Al Bagdaddy?
4255,Trump when he starts talking: 🖐👌🤌🫳🫴🤏
4256,"It’s not that Biden is too cowardly, but that Wall Street financial capital is too cowardly. They want nothing more than to make more money all day long."

4262,"funny how the huge crowds at every trump rally is ignored, yet every good detective will include pictures and videos to back up their claims"
4263,Biden just lost the nation…
4264,I hope the left now realize that these new rules for debates are hurting Biden. The reason why Biden didn&#39;t look as bad in their first debate is because Trump didn&#39;t let him speak half the time. Here Trump has no choice but to let him speak and with every sentence that comes out of Biden&#39;s mouth he buries himself deeper and deeper.
4265,I was making money when trump was president
4266,15000 new jobs?
4267,Biden : it’s ityhbvn
4268,I was in the comments sections before i even started the video. And you guys did not disappoint
4269,At least the old man Biden answered the initial question. TRUMP talked about what he felt like 😂.

4275,Trump is on record saying he doesn&#39;t like his war heroes captured in reference to John McCain. So much so that he wasn&#39;t allowed to attend his funeral. And you want us to believe you didn&#39;t say suckers and losers 😂.
4276,“The idea”- Biden. New drinking game for next debate. (Annoyed of hearing it every time he spoke)
4277,"We Iranians love <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump"">#Trump</a> because he does not pay ransom to dictators and Muslims.❤"

4281,Why would president  Biden debate formal president Trump😅😅😅
4282,There’s something wrong with this video Biden’s nose isn’t getting longer
4283,"I used to be on Trump&#39;s side since even Obama did not elected the second time. I even wanted to write a song for him to help election time. After Biden recognize Armenian Genocide, first president that did not lie, that he is going to recognize and after did not recognize like others. I never can forget and allways will be thankfull for that. Thank you thank you thank you mr. Biden God bless you. And when i heard that mr. Trump is talking about Biden, son, that is so shamefull to hit the person under the belt. He&#39;s son is not a politician, why you remembered him. That is not takes you higher. If someone is doing something like that, it means he can do almost everything for president chair on my opinion. I still have a respect to trump for other things and i would be on his side, if his oponent wouldn&#39;t be mr Biden. But as much as Biden in politics i will suport him. And it&#39;s very important to be very clear election,  to show peoples opinion. Because otherwise can happen things that is not exepted, understanded and much more.....<br>Who ever is winning it should be real on my opinion to go forward and not get back or put the world under the risk."
4284,Our economy is so bad now that 2  aged seniors have to be fighting for just a termed position.
4285,He said &quot;small black businesses &quot; lol
4286,"Trump said his retribution will be success, meaning tax cuts, lowering fuel costs, probably building the border wall, kicking out the illegal immigrants who already have criminal records from their home countries, creating new jobs, negotiating with Putin and Zelenski to end that war, bringing inflation down, etc., not going after his political opponents."
4287,The sad part is that this is not a sitcom its REALITY! ☝️☝️☝️
4288,Idiocracy is here.
4289,Thirty three minutes in and I think Biden&#39;s acting like a proper statesman and doing a great job and countering all of Trumps balderdash.

4291,You wouldn’t think it was real. But it is. And now not just the USA has a huge problem…
4292,uncle Joe leaving without say goodbye to Americans people?
4293,I do believe Putin would have  not started a war if Trump was the USA president.
4294,This was a bunch of malarkey…!
4295,😧😳
4296,I read the report where presidential historians voted Trump the worst American president of all time.  Biden was completely correct when he referred to their decision.
4297,No American flags on a presidential debate…. Plenty of CNN logos… lol 😂.  What a joke !
4298,Saleinsky if you will

4303,Biden for 90% of the debate: 😯
4304,"Trump is right .. America it&#39;s a joke at this point.<br>How can any country be respected with a president like this? guy looks like a zombie... he can&#39;t even articulate, without reading, his notes..."
4305,"People should decide now who are to lead?<br>If they can’t, then well it is what they have decided to live with in the next four years and it can be worse. God knows than us all why he will allow only these two to contest"
4306,"&quot;...tens of millions of Americans who are likely to vote for president Trump will be voting against American democracy.

4307,trump just let doipey joe talk easy
4308,"Both should be not allowed to contest, age has taken toll of both. Trump is still untrustworthy.<br>Biden is slow in what he wants to say and leaves a lot of ambiguity"
4309,Trump 2024
4310,"When did babbling become a legit sport? Biden is gold on this. <br>I&#39;m not voting for either, but at least Trump is alive."

4312,President Cartman I mean Trump.
4313,CNN IS A USELESS NEWS NETWORK AS IS MOST MSM.

4322,This comment section is why they didn’t want an audience
4323,Anyone else think he looks like that old guy from poltergeist 2?
4324,The world was at peace during Trump Era. Its actually between a war monger Biden and a peace lover Trump. The Biden killed thousands of kids in Palestine.
4325,Biden forgot American Soldiers died during his administration because he hardly looked up from his watch during their dignified transfer ceremony.
4326,"What&#39;s true and what&#39;s false?  What&#39;s the motive of the heart?  I can high five 🙏 both on the issues presented to us.  We didn&#39;t address the issues of our nation&#39;s core. Who ever becomes our next president, how long will it take for that administration to affect the average American.  Why is the rest of the world affecting how this country provides for itself?  Trump stated a while back, during his administration, America is self sufficient.  We have no need for reliance on any other country.  I believe that!!! Actually, politics is an area that can&#39;t be trusted.  The system is is in charge of a force unseen.  There is not one place on this earth that is honest and true.  War crimes is a charge fitting for all leaders.  To gain control, blood will be shed.  WAR ITSELF IS THE CRIME."
4327,Probably weeks before
4328,They gave him a list of the questions before  he got on stage... So he could have time to memorize the answers

4342,"Yea, Biden didnt show up. Where was the fire and energy he had at the State of the Union. Had it been that Biden that showed up, it would be a very different coverage. Im still voting for Biden. Trump lied in every single response. From when he botched the pandemic, to trying to say Biden lost more people then he did, when that is factually not true."

4354,"If Biden really thinks Roe v Wade overturn was this big of an issue for him, he&#39;s had over 3 years already to change it back. Why now is he saying he would do it in his next term if he didn&#39;t do it already and isn&#39;t doing it now while he still has the power to do it ? If think Biden is being disingenuous on this topic.<br>Also, our culture has changed dramatically over the last 51 years. Are those scholars that Biden is using as his support for his stance even alive anymore - I doubt it. We have different scholars now, and a different paradigm, and a totally different culture. Back in 1973 when Roe v Wade was passed, my parents never even locked the house door at night, nor the day while at work and they left their keys in the car&#39;s ignition all of the time and never locked the car doors when they weren&#39;t in the cars and never locked the car doors when they were in the car. We didn&#39;t even use seat belts then, nor did cars have headrests. It was a different time back then.  <br>Biden can&#39;t use the scholars of 51 years ago a to support his stance."

4360,"It is unbelievable how Trump lies to the viewers&#39; faces! Just one Point: Under Trump and until the end of his term, the stock market was never higher than it is now.

4449,Trum know what to do for usa but biden sllsllsl talk

4451,Reading comments is more entertaining than this 🤡 show.
4452,TRUMP2024!-SAY HIS NAME!-TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP!!
4453,I support iseral and trump
4454,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=714"">11:54</a> Biden can&#39;t even speak without losing his train of thought and he&#39;s supposed to be the &quot;president&quot;?? We have a clear winner 🤷🏻‍♀️"
4455,This is really like watching two old folks  arguing in an old folks home...this is not a debate. Epic entertainment.
4456,"England love Trump! Great man who loves his country,sooner he is back in office the better the WORLD will be!🇬🇧🇺🇸"
4457,"We’re screwed regardless, one guy won’t directly answer questions and the other guy can’t form a coherent sentence when he’s trying to answer questions."
4458,Thanks for keeping the comments open unlike weasel cnn
4459,Beans the game
4460,Colorado has blood on its hands thanks to Polis. Polis agrees to 9 month abortions
4461,President Trump wins 🏆 👏 <br>Trump 2.224
4462,"as a european, this is both entertainment and pure gold idk why"
4463,Biden looks tired.
4464,Governor Polis in Colorado is just like the state of Virginia. governor Polis is doing the same thing. He agreed to up to after the birth to murder
4465,biden is the only one who could make trump look like the better vote. we need new blood. why are these two unpresidential individuals our only choices. i will not vote for trump as he should not be in such a position. biden should have retired a few years ago. both men are bad news for this country. the overlords want trump to win to further usher in an authoritarian state. the U.S. is on the verge of collapse. the people have largely been systematically bastardizes. failure to pay the price of liberty.
4466,It seems Biden is reading somewhere
4467,Trump has won in the higher courts !!!   Thank God!  Biden is the real criminal !
4468,appreciate the cool and calmess to wait and respond. i appreciate this debate. not like pakistani or indian politician speaks and interupt others. at least they have pateince to wait and respond
4469,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1752"">29:12</a> he is speaking from the heart about this"
4470,Biden seems programmed like a robot
4471,Biden is a liar !!! He should be in prison for what he’s done !!
4472,So I have a question for the two political parties in America: Who will give Iraq weapons to protect itself? Who will protect Iraq’s influence from the corrupt Iranians? Who will help Iraq build its economy? Who will help Iraq build a huge army to confront the Iranian militias? Mansuf will protect Iraq with his life and blood. Is he Donald Trump or not? Joe Biden
4473,"If America chooses one of these two, it will be the biggest shame"
4474,"Joe Biden is a dam liar, eggs under Donald Trump was .99 cents, with biden in office eggs skyrocketed to $3.29 cents. Also you cant blame co-vid on Trump when people voluntarily/involuntarily had to leave their jobs and filed for unemployment because of state/local Democrat policies. Also Biden came up with these rules for the debate not the news. All that money going to black areas are actually going to non american illegal immigrants, look at chicago and new york as the smoking gun."
4475,"The tariffs will definitely raise the price level of US, your cost of living will be higher, and the factories will never go back to America, they may leave China for SEA or Africa."
4476,I&#39;m embarrassed I live here sometimes. A literal cartoon we live in.
4477,"I understand the standard for choosing and electing Presidents of the United States of America presently is at a free fall unlike what we had in the past in the likes of JFK, Franklin Roosevelt,Bill Clinton, Abraham Lincoln and a host of other  fantastic presidents"
4478,The blood 🩸 against the crips 💧
4479,No country is scared of Biden or respects like they do trump and trump is a great businessman man and puts our country first
4480,have you guys seen the jjk mcdonald’s collab?

4483,"what a joke ! clearly, both are not mentally and physically enough for the presidency .. My Goodness"
4484,Катастрофа
4485,Hmm this is going to be tough
4486,Thumbs up if you think Biden peed himself during the debate
4487,"This Elderly abuse is very hard to watch !😳😲🫣<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23facepalm"">#Facepalm</a>"
4488,Cakewalk for Trump🎉
4489,Trump 2024 🇺🇸🫡
4490,I’m Surprised 😮 Joe Was Able To Stand As Long As He Did. Look Like He Missed His Afternoon Nap 💤
4491,"How about white families?  It’s just poor people made poor by more jobless pouring over the boarder.  ACA?  A joke.  Working poor can’t afford it.   What do we do?  We go without.   Forget the nonsense.  Black jobs?  White jobs?  Black housing?  White housing?  Still separate but equal, yes, equally bankrupt."
4492,Joe looks like he&#39;s listening to an earpiece while Trump is speaking.
4493,"I&#39;m European and this felt like an episode from a reality show! Have courage people cause in the end no one will help you, stay true to each other and don&#39;t divide for those two."
4494,This is a typical compliment that you cannot argue to a person with mental illness... It is a loosing end for Trump i guess. Biden doesn&#39;t even know what he was saying.
4495,"When you lie you pay.<br>I cannot believe that a sitting president can deliberately and blatantly lie to Americans with impunity. He should be held to a higher standard not a lower standard. Imagine Artificial Intelligence fact checking the president (whoever he is) instantly and when he is caught lying, he is automatically fined and pays the opposing party $100 and this amount doubles with every subsequent lie. This would go a long way in fixing things and could also be applied to the media. Free speech should not include deliberate lies to satisfy a corrupt agenda."

4501,"Have trouble sleeping?<br>No need for Valium or other precription drugs. Here&#39;s a natural treatement, just listen to Biden &amp; you&#39;ll fall in a deep sleep like a baby."
4502,"Any chance people will realize there are more than 2 candidates instead of endlessly bitching about Trump and Biden?<br>Probably not, but we can hope."
4503,how about we get rid of both of them and elect another president
4504,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3928"">1:05:28</a> lol"

4508,If Biden wins this year I might as well make a will soon because we&#39;ll be done
4509,"No notes ,   sleepy Joe has a pen in his hand. BUT,   CNN, SAYS AND DORS NOTHING"
4510,the devil wears red tie🤣😁😂
4511,trump is best
4512,WTH....when Biden approaches the podium he reaches down and grabs something under the podium.  Later he is reading from something.   There arent supposed to be any papers or notes etc.

4521,Biden  is so full of it.
4522,"I wish we had  younger  candidates..the lack of energy is scary and sad. We should be taking care of the senior citizens of the world, not letting them run our world."
4523,-Don&#39;t make fun of Biden.  Bc about 1/3 Of those reading this will be the same way when you&#39;re old. We just don&#39;t know now.

4529,I’m only here because I know this is gonna be stupid 😂
4530,I feel like Joe Biden is being abused by his &#39;carers&#39; (family/Obama&#39;s ppl). why is he standing there at all? The poor guy has no idea. <br><br>Why is Biden getting last chace to reply? And when they go back to trump to reply they give him an add on question.<br>Seems rigged to make it easier for Biden.<br><br>Trump is no saint but he is a good business man. I dont like trump i dont have to. But i would vote for him if i had a vote. He sees America like a business which is why he will be way more successful for Americans than sleepy joe.
4531,TRUMP!!🎉
4532,"Our CIA has also been setting up and loosely maintaining fentanyl centers supplied by China in prep to phase South American states. It’s the same reason the boarders had to be opened. They’ve been hiring cartels to replace gangs with more heartless, business minded pawns."
4533,If Biden opens his mouth he’s lying.
4534,Biden just buried himself

4542,I love how CNN in the beginning try to say that groceries were only up by 20% when really they&#39;re up more like 100 to 200%.<br>Another thing is he talking about corporate greed but you get corporations have been making a whole lot more money under his administration than under any other administration and now he wants to fix the problems that he created himself people are not stupid. <br>People know that these problems started after Biden took office. <br>Ready to spend $180 at the grocery store is now almost $400 and that&#39;s no lie! FJB!!! GET OUT OF THE WAY AND LET TRUMP FIX THE ECONOMY THAT BIDEN DESTROYED.

4577,I was watching republican senator John Kennedy question doctors dance and circle around their answers about abortions. He actually held up cards of diagrams of fetuses and than questioning about them about  performing late abortions. It was pretty gruesome and barbaric and even they were uncompfortable admitting the truth about the procedures. Its sick!!
4578,Comments say it all.   People are finally starting to wake up.  There actually may be hope for humanity.
4579,"Why didn&#39;t  you let Obama fill in for you, Sir?😉"

He can no longer run for a second term.  We&#39;re really sorry about all those getting raped by their inlaws, spouses, brothers and sisters..  you will no longer be able to take that pregnacy to term then have the baby killed after being born."
4588,When did Trump say that?

4621,"CNN, has to be embarrassed for this debate and Biden should not be running for president, the man doesn’t know what is going on, he doesn’t remember or knows there is a video of him saying exactly what President Trump said. It’s pathetic that the democrats are supporting him to run for president, just pathetic!!!! By the way? Exactly WHO is running OUR Country???? Because it’s not Biden! And if it is GOD HELP US"
4622,If Biden hadn’t been struck by a DEW he’d be the clear choice but The CIA is childish enough to think the world can’t put 2 and 2 together so here we are getting gaslit 😅

4632,how embarrassing for you people on every level
4633,"I am not for Biden,  but I feel very sorry for him. Its really elder abuse what Jill is allowing. What wife of any kind would betray a husband this way? I have seen 8 minutes and am afraid because  I know  this debate gets worse for Biden  as he runs out if steam let&#39;s say."

4638,"These two men spend the whole debate bashing each other rather than giving examples of what they&#39;re going to do better. they obviously have no clue what the debate is supposed to be neither answer any questions thoroughly they end their time with statements about the other. Neither of them is good for America period I hate that people can&#39;t see that. this whole debate just made me mad!  America is a disaster, and this debate shows that the future of our country is going to be no better."

4642,"Biden had a good start. That is good. I like these rules, because both men were so unruly 3 years ago during their debate."
4643,Trump burying Biden in this guarantees another pandemic will be manufactured
4644,The saddest part is that there is no third option
4645,"Number one I like vanilla ice cream.<br>Number two I like it on a waffle cone.. (grumble, grumble) that&#39;s how I&#39;d solve global warming.<br><br>Mr. President the question was how would you prevent a global war?"
4646,"Blink, Joe!! 😃"
4647,"They need to put the Secklers in prison. How do you open a legal dope house and lie that it’s not addictive and reward salesmen,saleswomen,and doctors that up the mgs of patients to assure strong addictions make $14 billion dollars and only get fined $6 billion leaving $8 billion in profit while it’s proven that they broke many laws along the way and many people died behind these laws broken and they never step one foot in a police station let alone a prison baffles me. Big Pharma are the biggest dope dealers in the world but as long as you play the game, by giving millions to candidate parties, and have buddies in high places I guess you can break the law, kill millions,start a pandemic and still walk away with billions. While a young poor kid just trying to feed his family off the black market that you created get caught with a few pills go to jail for years and decades in some instances."

4654,"Joe Biden Debe renunciar,  en su lugar  debe entrar Michelle Obama, es la apuesta más aceptable para esta contienda. Si No,  los Democratas no tendrán oportunidad de ganar.   De  entrar Michelle, haría contrapeso con Claudia Sheinbaum."
4655,"This was way past Joe&#39;s bed time I almost feel bad for him watching this but he was the one that wanted to do this debate so badly. Now the whole world knows he has dementia and can barely stand anymore even after practicing for this debate for a whole week in a bunker.<br><br>Just a disastrous performance; having this guy as our president for the last 3.5 years has destroyed our country, I pray Trump can fix this mess Biden has caused when he is elected we need him more now than ever."
4656,Hey CNN why did Biden have notes and a penin his hand and still fail to read them properly?
4657,Jesus Biden is a disgrace to America we need a president Like Trump
4658,"Trump : National issue, Border issue, Economic Conditions etc…..<br>Biden : The idea…..😂"
4659,He is saying putting is a war criminal yet from what I&#39;ve seen on the front lines of the Russian Ukraine war Ukraine is committing just as many if not more war crimes than Russia ever thought about
4660,"This is horrifying! Out of almost 390,000,000 people these 2 are the best we can find?!?! Our country is doomed 😮😢"
4661,I feel bad for Biden watching this Debate😢😅
4662,"As a black man I will put this on my mother’s grave i promise you that I would have never ever voted for Trump because of all the silly stuff. However, as I listen to him, I will vote for him for 2 reasons. Our Soldiers and being a retiree and the boarders. This current president has done nothing for those issue. He has just made it worse. Look @ the boarders. It’s a hot mess. They are coming over taken all kinds of jobs."
4663,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4576"">1:16:16</a> did trump just soil himself whats that noise"
4664,"How dare you accuse Trump in supporting nazis when you, Biden, send money to ukraine that has openly supported nazi ideals and have a nazi as their heroes. They marched in the center of Kiev with tourches, but you send billions of dollars to thwm. What a hypocrete."
4665,Notice biden didn&#39;t even think about denying the fact that he left us citizens and troops in Afghanistan
4666,Summary of this... : &quot;you lie&quot;.<br>What a level... of debate
4667,The whole world is blowing up over him this couldn&#39;t be more true about biden 😔
4668,Why CNN doesnt allow comments

4670,Can we PLEASE get Biden out the running!! We need better options
4671,Sleepy Joe is sleeping down in his basement still
4672,This is cruel putting Biden up there
4673,The left is toast and I&#39;m here for it
4674,I made the mistake of rewatching the debate.  Biden needs to do the right thing and not only drop out but resign.  Having Kamala as president is terrifying but it is the right thing for the country.
4675,Why are they not fact checked live? 😆
4676,This is like being offered two meals that you can’t eat because ur allergic to them.

4679,Mandates 👎🏾 Never forget!
4680,"Last week, Michigan had 105% of it&#39;s residents registered to vote. 🙄 In 2020, 57% of the ballots voted."
4681,I love this ☝️ historic debate.<br>People finally have to acknowledge Trump is BETTER! 🤌
4682,Why is Biden face expression so funny 😂
4683,Mayorkas just signed an agreement with Panama. Oscar Blue Ramirez has a video on YT
4684,"Today, Chicago announced that they&#39;re giving i.i.s driver&#39;s licenses for &quot;safety.&quot; In other words, so they can vote. Call your state reps, peeps."
4685,Saya rasa Trump akan kembali ke gedung putih 🎉🎉
4686,I wonder why Americans voted for Biden. He&#39;s the most ridiculous person I have seen. So much disinformation coming from his end.
4687,Jill Biden should be charged with “elder abuse” for not getting her husband to step down.
4688,"Lies from Biden. He said that Putin wants the Nato Country of Belarussa, and that is just inaccurate. Belarussia is not a Nato country. Plus the hosts already said what Putin&#39;s terms are, and Biden contiinues his propaganda of Russia neing a bad guy. Of course, he is a war profeteer and needs justification for his lies."
4689,"PRESIDENT BIDEN IS,  FOR US COMPARE THEN AND NOW! INCOMPETENT,  STUTTERS, FRAGILE, SPEAKS INCOMPLETE SENTENCES, LIES, ECONOMY COST UP, FOOD PRICES UP,.. BORDERS"

4692,JT &amp; DB are horrible journalist and terrible moderators—way to go CNN!
4693,Trump is delusional
4694,This just hurts to listen to however Biden catching fades from trump tho just get old Joey outta office and into hospice already
4695,&quot;period. period! period!!&quot; -biden
4696,"They continue accussing Trump of what happened during the pandemic. All the countries suffered an economy drop.  President Trump mandate was every governor of a state should deal with it according with the situation on that state. They don&#39;t like to mention that.  Some states did better, like the state of Florida thanks to the governor decisions there, than other states.<br><br>In one way, I feel sorry for Biden.  He doesn&#39;t have Kamala Harris and Nanci Pelosi helping him. Not like they did much anyway. President Trump address the nation just like presidents in the past, and not reading from papers written by some other people telling him what to say.<br><br>Trump as a president has a better military mindset than Biden. That&#39;s why countries  don&#39;t respect Biden since he took office."
4697,Biden forgot to kneel down before the debate?!? Let&#39;s go Brandon!
4698,I’m in a small town in north Iowa and these people are taking over our town
4699,"Dana made a motion with her hand at one point, but trying to hide it. They probably edited it out. Rita caught it on Sky News."
4700,"Please 🙏🏽 don’t let BIDEN be our president.. NO AMERICAN IN THEIR RIGHT MIND CANT POSSIBLY THINK THAT BIDEN IS COMPETENT TO HANDLE THE LOAD OF THE MIGHTY USA!! He acts like he should be in a convalescent home no disrespect, but he’s not capable"

4702,Zelensky&#39;s wife just became the first buyer of a Bugatti Turbillon. $4.5 million euros. He spent $1.5 million in jewelry at Cartier earlier this year.
4703,The only thing I heard Dana Bash say during the debate was how nipley it was inside
4704,Wouldn’t trump be the first president to come back into office instead of having his 2 consecutive terms or leaving after one?
4705,The idea 😂
4706,Trump will win
4707,It&#39;s funny how Trump  looks at Biden.
4708,Bro something is wrong with Biden 😦
4709,TRUMP 2024!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4710,This is genuinely sad for the united states of america. Biden had strong highs but that wouldn&#39;t be longer than a minute compilation because he kept stumbling over his words. And on the other side we have a criminal who would only lie and duck questions.
4711,"Groceries doubled or tripled, they didn&#39;t go up $20."
4712,"His little cough is from shortness of breath, which you get from too much speed, like Adderall. He&#39;s been doing it for several months. Plus, his eyes barely blink. Lol"
4713,This video has been edited from the live version that was seen on the night of the debate! Once again changed to help Biden
4714,Biden brought in criminal illegal immigrants to get votes kill our economy to make this nation closer and closer to become a communist country . <br><br>The truth is our flag is nothing to feel proud of anymore. <br><br>God have grace and mercy on this nation .
4715,"First question is already biased and not true. A basket of groceries that cost $100 then is not $120 now. It’s more like $220. Also, for $120 you aren’t really getting much. For a family of 4 that may be 2/3 meals tops. Jake Tapper, you are a joke just like your network the Commie News Network!"
4716,"Exelent job CNN , welcome back"
4717,"Trump did more for this country than any president in 20 years. Joe is like an empty puppet how people in conspiracy documentaries explain the presidency,…. But in real life. A basket of groceries that was $100 under trump is now $300 under Biden .. you think I’m complaining about $20 bucks???"
4718,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4683"">1:18:03</a> &quot;fentanyl and its byproducts went down... for awhile.&quot;<br>No it didnt, Joe. I did opiates for 14 years. I&#39;ve been clean for a little over a year. <br>Fentanyl is EVERYWHERE."

4723,Prescription drugs price has gone down and u get to use that savings at the grocery store and gas station. Thanks Joey 😂<br>A couple minutes in and I&#39;m fuming. This should be good
4724,One single example stood out among many statements that seemed dishonest from Joe Biden. He said early in the debate that insulin would be down to $15 but during the closing statements that price had changed to $35. Joe Biden in almost certainly being dishonest to the American people and just making up these numbers to tell everyone what he thinks they want to hear in order to get the votes he desires.
4725,Biden is delusional  and has selected memory lost 🤯
4726,Not seeing how Biden could go another 4 years!
4727,Who&#39;s playing biden now 😅
4728,Trump gas prices under $2 Bidens gas prices $5 dollars. And prices on almost everything has doubled because on our incompetent president.
4729,Good bless trump I love him and he’s our president
4730,The man who going to make America great again 💪
4731,And when I was a child I thought people who ran for presidency had to be intelligent.
4732,Not american but the world was more peaceful during Trump.
4733,The Democrats had the last four years to find or prepare a Democratic Presidential contender. Can’t believe they are so surprised and shocked during and after this debate. Biden said he would only serve one term… he should have stuck to this.
4734,"Biden sounds like every word he says could be his last, sounds like a movie character before they die getting their last words out loool"
4735,Joey is lost and pitiful!
4736,"Why not Joe Biden step down and let kamala Harris run for the election, because I don&#39;t think even Donald Trump should be president again he started many Of the nonsense which going on in the world right now 😂😂😂😂"
4737,This is embarrassing  why biden hasn&#39;t from a single constructive sentence 😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
4738,"“The idea” “but the idea” “by the way, the idea” “the idea”"
4739,Senior citizen vs senior citizen. Which one do you want to ru(i)n our country?
4740,I’m not a fan of either of the moderators but they really did a good job not intervening and letting it play out according to the rules.
4741,"You can tell Obiden has a hiden earpiece!! Why Obama is talking to Joe through his earpiece, he turns away from the debate so he can concentrate on what obama is saying to him."
4742,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2580"">43:00</a> biden: omg he&#39;s right but but i gotta think of some-some-something."
4743,You’re telling me that these are my only two choices…?
4744,"Hey Joe if you cannot perform the duties that the job you were elected to do including speaking on the debate <a href=""http://stage.how/"">stage.How</a> can you be trusted to protect our country on the world stage the answer is you cannot and you have not ."
4745,"The next debate should take place in Florida,and the next one in Las Vegas"

4757,"Why criticize joe Biden for his part in the debate, Trump lied his way thru the debate.  Does his actions fad so fast with people that he is right in his assessment that he could shoot some one and could get away with.  That comment has been referred to often and yet he believes he could pull this off that people are so under his thumb.  He shouldn’t be allowed to run for any office in America.  Please consider this before you support this ideology."
4758,Biden cannot be running the country   Dems allow this. Our national security is in danger.
4759,The  Opioid  Crisis is manufactured by guess who?
4760,The truth about the last election is out.  A stuffed ballot is not a legal vote.

There were probably so many things that he wanted to say that he couldn&#39;t even decide in his brain what he was going to actually say. There were just too many ridiculous statements coming from rump. There are so many places to check him a person doesn&#39;t even know where to start LOL

There&#39;s a couple other repeated phrases, but if you included those too, you&#39;d either die before the end of the debate, or if you&#39;re lucky, end up in an ICU needing a liver transplant!

4915,"This would be so much more enjoyable to watch if they were each given Plinko chips or something, to drop down a board.

4997,"Bad Grandpa is lost in the sauce. The economy is absolutely tanking. I talk to dozens a people everyday. A lot of them in the construction/housing business. ALL OF THEM are desperate for work right now. They are not selling houses. Some are still being built. But it is coming to a standstill. Meanwhile, a house here in SouthWest Florida was about 350K in 2020 (pre pandemic). Now, the same houses are over 750K (more than double). Groceries are probably 80-100% more expensive. Not 20% like the media portrayed. The media is just buying their time to reveal the TRUE data of the economy. This will be sometime in Jan/Feb of 2025 (after the election)."

1,"If Biden wins again, the election is 100 per cent rigged. Im pretty sure the last one was to be honest."
2,Joe Biden for President
3,Is there no better candidate apart from Trump and Biden? It will be much better to engage young-minded youths in politics. 30 -60 years of age.
4,I felt like Adam Sandler was was going to take the stage and say. &quot; Welcome to another Saturday Night alive!&quot;
5,"The biggest thing to understand from this is that this is not a Biden issue. It is the entire Democrat party. After all, they are clearly the ones that have been driving this. Entire term into the ground. It&#39;s painfully obvious that biden is not in the driver seat. They are also the ones that have been lying to you about this man&#39;s mental. Fitness. And they are still lying to us. Don&#39;t be stupid enough to think that You can vote for a better democrat."
6,Does Biden starma?
7,Obama Bin Biden
8,"I have never seen an old man that&#39;s so good at lying, why is everybody only talking about October the 7th,why can&#39;t people talk about what led to October the 7th"
9,Americans help us vote Trump again
10,On president Biden first election I bet he will win and only a one time president! He should allow another Democrat run with Trump ! Otherwise! Sad😊
11,"Biden walks out on stage, because of how used to giving speeches in n company of his close yes man circle he walks onto the stage hearing a roaring crowd chanting <br><br> Crowd- “4 more years, 4 more years” <br><br>Biden waves at the moderators and the crowd. The lights stop him from seeing the waves of people that aren’t actually present because he forgot there was no audience. <br><br><br> Biden- “thank you thank YOU”<br><br>As if he was capping off the audience volume. <br><br>If you watch his speeches you’ll notice the same Means of capping off the audience for a quick rebuttal. <br><br>Biden actually said even more but they cut off his mic"
12,I didn&#39;t like trump that much but I&#39;d rather vote for him than biden that much
13,"&quot;They&#39;re doing more for veterans than ever before,&quot; Biden says. I&#39;m sorry, but with what staff? The ones you pushed out with vaccine mandates before deciding to not require shots after all? The ones who jumped ship to other hospitals when the VA couldn&#39;t match the pay increases everyone else offered to keep up with the inflation your administration caused? The VA I&#39;m in touch with had to cut back on the total number of beds they could fill because they don&#39;t have enough nurses to tend to a full building. A vet that I knew was unable to get admitted for in-patient hospice because the wait list for a bed was just too long."

22,"If I have to hear &quot;we&#39;re in a position where&quot;, or &quot;the idea that&quot; one more time..."
23,"Joe FYI This country is already bankrupt. Your reckless spending doesn&#39;t help the USA at all. Look at the National Debt Joe and its crazy interest every minute that goes by. I am wondering if you ever took a college course in Economics. But if you did, you forgot all the basics. Yoru idea that Tax and Spend, illegal immigration, your continual 6 working hours a day, and continual vacations tells the American people you just don&#39;t care about us."

56,"Why do we want a president that can’t stop with the cursing. I can’t believe that Joe Biden goes on National TV and forgets what he’s saying. Why would we want a president that is so far away from God! Please don’t re-elect this man, that is willing to let the killing of innocent children go on."
57,...
58,"Being a Swede, I could answer the very first question about the economy easily. None of them answered the question. They started pissing on each other from the 1st second. Why can&#39;t they just focus on the questions? Well, my question is rhetoric. We know the answer. It saddens me to see the US falling like this."

73,"Trump must be intelligent to be able to focus on what Biden is saying and decipher it without loosing focus.  <br><br>Biden actually is a lot more intelligible than I was expecting, but he still fumbles his words so often that it is difficult to track what he is saying."

99,"Monty Brewster/Richard Pryor had the right idea in running &quot;None Of The Above&quot; in Brewster&#39;s Millions in 1985 when running for NYC Mayor.

130,"America had a black president that was revolutionary,  America had a business man as a president another remarkable history and now currently  are led by ambitious  nd a dreamer but unfortunately old . I believe the country has proven to the world that they give people opportunities and we respect that. But now it&#39;s not time for emotions nd keeping up with records but to get a true leader to lead the country. America is going down slowly due to its weak leadership . They should check african leaders , every african country that has followed that pattern of emotions nd chrrismetic leadership they are donw nd out.. Goodluck America 🇺🇸"
131,these ppl get on my nerves. let them response to each other before you ask questions. &amp; you keep asking questions like you’re trying to avoid the facts that either of them may be trying to speak. i get that these are important questions but quit asking them back to back like that..
132,God Bless America
133,Biden: “We are the most admired country in the world”..”with the finest history in the world..” Oh my God: this is absolutely hilarious. 😂 Joe coming to Earth for one day after living in the space throughout his life 😂😂😂
134,So many rules feels like a game show 🤣
135,"Big shame , for  America"
136,"Trump again. He will again in the <a href=""http://w.house/"">W.House</a>"
137,Close our Borders
138,Biden sending billions overseas we need that money in America
139,if Biden will win again! China and Russia will be very happy and other nation will not respect Americans! You have one of the softest President the US ever! no more Biden from the Philippines
140,Trump won
141,"Yes his son Hunter ,and Joe can be convicted for  sending and allowing   innocent people who know the truth about your administration"
142,"Biden made sense but he did not speak with authority, Trump lacked sense &amp; honesty but spoke with authority. I prefer a guy who sometimes makes mistakes &amp; is a little physically unstable but has ethics. Biden has not compulsively tweeted like a child having a tantrum or been moronic enough to suggest injecting bleach, he has acted with the dignity his office. Note Trump sidestepped his position on Ukraine &quot;Russia should keep all land it [invaded] now occupies. He also pivoted on the issue of taxing the rich. Illegal immigration actually rose when Trump was in power, he restricted legal migration which could benefit America; building a wall is pointless when illegal immigrants can use boats to avoid it. If Biden continues he must become more assertive as Americans equate confidence with security. It scares me that America may vote for Trump who has a long history of crime, corruption, deception &amp; scandal &amp; &quot;would like to have the full authority of Putin over America&quot;. It seems that America has not just lost it&#39;s judgement, it has lost it&#39;s reason."
143,"Yes the Biden Administration has destroyed innocent people and their families  , innocent people had to go to jail under his administration bc we know the truth"
144,America deserves better..

151,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1986"">33:06</a> Belorussia is not NATO 😂😂😂😂"
152,Having a president who looks like he is constipating and is unfit for presidency really shows how developing we really are in our country 😂
153,Why dont CNN comment on his speech impediment... i thibk they on his side
154,"oh my God Trump is a terrible man with his antagonising words, so bitter!"
155,A basket of groceries that cost $100 in 2020 cost over $120 now???  Man I need to shop where he is shopping.  More like $170+

161,The Bidens need to be tried for treason
162,Biden was responding to questions with prepared answers <br>Trump got real time questions from the moderator.
163,Bring crypto back
164,"Mostly what I’m hearing is a lot of conjecture and opinion, not a lot of statistics or facts. They’re just playing the blame game. Why do we have to have dinosaurs in office."
165,"When was the last election in 2020, everyone around, including celebrities, hated Trump, everyone was for Biden, Trump was ready to be torn to pieces in the street, in comments on YouTube videos he was hated, you can find these 2020 videos and read the comments. What happened now, people?"
166,If you don&#39;t lower the taxes for the rich they would just take their money out of the country and it will destroy the economy
167,😂😮
168,Made me laugh when they talked about golf😂😂😂
169,"as an egyptian, i heard &quot;grocery that costed 100$ then now costs 120 $&quot; and i started laughing, to us what costed 100 pounds then now costs 1500"

173,"I wonder that this two old men are still strong and eagerness to serve for the seat of president of USA, How luck America peoples for their reasonable leaders."
174,the hilarious show i had ever seen
175,"its hard not to LOL...Biden looks mortified. Is it crazy to question whether he maybe has been fed a false narrative, by a go between. America really has been run by the same people/countries posting their troops (or just ppl whom where strategically coerced) in America disguised as immigrants. I&#39;m not even pro trump, but Joe DID seek retribution, and what&#39;s sad is it&#39;s not even surprising. I highly doubt the founding fathers included the 4th amendment with the idea it could be circumvented by one mans &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot;. America was built off of freedom, yet ppl isn&#39;t even free to control their own consciousness. This is the country that technically defines addiction as a disease but nonviolent addicts take up much of the prison space costing something to the tune of $80,000 each per year...some sitting 20 year sentences for a drug that is now legal and sold in stores....Im willing to bet a ONE time payment of $80,000 would&#39;ve prevented SO much suffering, ultimately getting passed down for generations if used towards prevention, with mental health resources. The LAST thing we need is to fund prisons and police any further."
176,Trump 😎<br>Biden 😨
177,Just take a look at Biden’s face
178,America is COOKED 😭🙏
179,As someone in the military....I CANNOT STAND JOE BIDEN..... ZERO respect for joe biden and his crooked people
180,"I think Donald Trump or Joe Biden shouldn&#39;t be president at all, I think we should have 2 new candidates., Does anyone agree?"
181,Joe should be charged with treason
182,Yall js vote for lana del ray instead tbh
183,"As usual, the Republican propaganda machine snipped the single worst 5 seconds to make Joe look bad, but he gave a vastly superior answer to EVERY QUESTION hands down."
184,TRUMP 2024
185,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1015"">16:55</a> minutes into the debate Biden began a nonsensical response after speaking for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=63"">1:03</a> minutes into his allotted 2 minutes response time. The CNN mediator saved him with an assertively stated “thank you” that cut him off in mid-sentence although he still had time left. She spared him the embarrassment of almost another minute (57 more seconds) of a gibberish response."
186,This is like a stand-up comedy during COVID-19 😂😂😂
187,Joe Biden was stuttering alot.
188,Look at both of them😂😂

191,"that isnt such a thing as white, spanic or black jobs. jobs are jobs period"
192,Since the first question is a straight up lie i dont expect much from this.
193,How many times does Biden says &quot;the idea&quot; waving his barbie hands?     ❤Trump ❤
194,"Groceries are double, not 20% more... good grief. Fast food is four times more in my area. Their &quot;fact-checkers&quot; for the announcer questions are waaaay off."
195,TRUMP 2025 MAGA !!
196,"I don&#39;t think anyone questioned the USA being the most powerful country on Earth since at least 36 years. But the USA is still a joke to everybody. But where these two senior citizens are wrong: It was not in 2021 and not in 2017 when it started, it started way earlier and gets worse every year. Take this example: the US-President is one of the most powerful leaders any democratic country has.  Yet the debate looks like a discussion in a senior residency..."
197,"Send Biden home to rest and enjoy his remaining fruitful years. He has worked very hard, no need to work yourself till your last breath <br><br>Anyone who vote this man in for another term is an abuser"
198,We finally beat Medicare
199,Presidential Immunity has just been amended by SCOTUS; The president can Seal team 6 trump if he wants to do it as an official act.

154,So what I gather from this is that he never cared so much about the people but about proving his nay sayers wrong. Jill “looked” the last and from a PR stand point they wanted to seem like the perfect Irish. Catholic family 😂<br><br>So he was always fake…

169,"America hasn&#39;t grown past it&#39;s distractive racism. We have untold millions and billions being invested into technology such as AI and robot building. There&#39;s nothing wrong with these technologies, but what actually has become a non-common sense issue, is the fact that every penny invested into these machines could&#39;ve been used to heal the problems that haunts America today. Homelessness, low  job hiring, starvation, and a climate that&#39;s unpredictable with a poor ozone layer where UV light will be increasing. Robots and AI will take away jobs usually worked by the lower-class and minorities... Gone. Robots only, no humans allowed. Invest in the America people. Not becoming lazier. What&#39;s great about a country that&#39;s running on all cylinders, because they leftout the core of backbreaking black, brown, red and yellow that not only built America, but made America what it is today... That&#39;s America!"

197,Trump 2024
198,"Just watching this debate. Actually, I don’t think Joe did as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Yes he does look older and more frail than DonOld. But I thought his responses were solid. And I think his stuttering problem was an issue. BUT DonOLD is a liar!! And the lies just roll out his mouth so easily. UM Charlottesville happened. We all saw it. The US is more energy independent under Biden than Trump. The data shows that during Biden’s term the US has exported more energy including petroleum than imported and we have produced more energy than consumed. NATO is not saying hailing the successes of Trump.  It’s very fascinating to watch the lies just roll out of his mouth like it’s the truth."
199,"Trump is the same age now that Biden was when he was elected.  Trump&#39;s frequent, infantile and incoherent rants suggest cognitive impairment.  Let&#39;s not repeat history.  We do not need another octogenarian president!"

To this extent Trump is brilliant because he knows the water will boil the more you turn up the gas pilot."

299,Biden: 😦😵‍💫🫡 🤤
300,I-it’s just sad to see Biden so down bad mentally. No matter how I feel about his ruling- I still think it’s sad. It’s like seeing an 85 yo work as a fast food worker.
301,"Woman for TRUMP , latinos for TRUMP 2024!!!🇺🇸🫶🏻"

303,Love you president Biden ❤
304,Trump: “Let’s not act like children!”<br>Biden: “You are a child!”<br><br>These two are like 2 2nd graders arguing on the playground😂😂
305,If groceries went up by $20 I don’t think anyone would notice or even care enough to be complaining
306,I used to be a Democrat my whole life until I see how corrupt and dirty and lying they are. I have now turned Republican because I see how good America ran when Donald Trump was in office it ran at the top speed. The best it has ever ran.  So we need donald trump back in office twenty twenty 4 make america great again
307,The republicans got the veterans and the bikers behind them. And the american military
308,Some of these comments about Biden have my ribs hurting 😂😂
309,Should be called democrat crime
310,Did he say asylum?<br>Explain that one..are we building more asylum?
311,America has never ran so strong as when trump was our president
312,"We never had no wars when Trump was in charge. There are all kinds of wars going on. Now that the democrats are in charge, this is b*<b>****</b> Too many innocent lives gone because of the democrats."
313,"Trump is the only one telling the truth in God&#39;s name.<br> I hope all Americans know this because we all are backing Trump, he will.  Be R President.<br>In twenty twenty four I cannot stand the lies. Lies that come out of Biden&#39;s mouth.<br> He is so full of s*** Just like Harris.  Whoever votes for  Harris, don&#39;t give a s*** about America. Trump knows how to run America and he runs it like a business and he is doing d*** good. He&#39;s the best President America has ever had.<br> And thank you, Lord. He will be our President again in 2024."
314,"Trump is the only one telling the truth in God&#39;s name.<br> I hope all Americans know this because we all are backing Trump, he will.  Be R President.<br>In twenty twenty four I cannot stand the lies. Lies that come out of Biden&#39;s mouth.<br> He is so full of s*** Just like Harris.  Whoever votes for  Harris, don&#39;t give a s*** about America."
315,"Why does America just have to choose who’s the least worst? Why can’t they have options where they have to debate who the best of the best is, rather than just trying to figure out who won’t lead them into even more ruin?"
316,"Trump is for America and Trump is for the American people.<br>Trump is the best president America has ever had.<br> And American people, what Trump is our President of America?<br> Post it."
317,Trump is the best President America has ever seen and never had. Trump is the greatest. He is tall America and the American people. So people vote for Donald Trump to save America. We need Trump in the White House.

370,The idea. The idea. The idea. 🙄 number one. Number two. Number three.
371,Biden just lies everyime he talks! Atleast Obama spoke the truth a couple times.
372,"Love how they read off all the negative things that have happened under Biden and he’s like blah blah best in history and acts like what they say isn’t facts and if he lies enough, people will believe him. Poor old geezer doesn’t even know what’s going on…Jill reads him affirmations for a bedtime story. Kamala pulled the strings, now people wanna act like she’d be different. And Trumps the “biggest threat to democracy” yet they didn’t even allow dems to vote for a nominee, hypocrisy. Whatever side you’re on I feel bad that was taken from the democrats. I mean that’s democracy."
373,"How did you guys let this happen, Americans? Wait …..my country is going down too …time to go to Mars"

395,"Biden didn&#39;t increase taxes, he increased everything except taxes."
396,What is it with this dramatic music 😂😂😂 All that is missions is a sped up zoom from space and oversized fireworks
397,Half of the debate of Biden I couldn’t even understand. It seems he was cold while talking!
398,"As a rhetorician, watching Biden here is torture. I couldn&#39;t see the whole debate. So much wrong. Weak voice, slurring speech, sentences not fullfilled, seems confused and kept thinking &quot;he should be in a nursing home&quot;. It is absolutely MAD that he ran for another period. Thank goodness someone got to him and finally realized he needed to pass the torch on"

412,"Trump for president he knows what’ he’s doing, he’s been there still regardless that passed four years nonstop keeping up, don’t give Kamala presidency, she only cares about women’s health and winning and I’m a women we need a man in office, that knows everything going on in America not just health care."
413,<b>Biden starts speaking</b><br>Trump: 🤣😀😐😟
414,What in the heck did Biden say I couldn’t stand a single thing or a point he was trying to get across
415,i think all candidates are not good. but the best is trump according to the threat of islam and arabs to every western country including europe and israel.
416,There is no way this isn&#39;t a skit. The way he walks in pointing at nothing looks like he just woke up from a nap. This has to be a south park episode.

We can&#39;t afford to keep doing this, and we used to come home with more than we do now, so much for the Democrats being good for regular people. I hope we have all learned a lesson. I hope it&#39;s not too late."
485,Biden steals white wealth and converts it - that’s where his numbers come from.
486,Biden is Obama 2.0

488,"Not everyone who goes to an event like the president&#39;s speach goes because they have good intentions and there were groups who went just to do crime and did so, the vice president had a get out of jail fund for demorats. Pelosie is responsible for not having troops at the White House and left it vulnerable. To not have security is ridiculous.... bottom line."

490,Biden sounds like a 5 year old trying to have a fight with Trump
491,Trump is not saying (not to allow the womans health to be allowed) with abortion. The victimation of the homeless is worse under Biden especially women and veterans.
492,Biden points at the podium as if to ask “do I stand here?”  His team went over it with him 30 seconds earlier.
493,Democratic party paid for mayhem in our biggest cities in the last year of Trump&#39;s presidency aside from costs of covid. Costs of goods and services are at an all time high under the Biden Administration aside from the covid mandate. The open borders policy doesn&#39;t benefit citizens of this country and only makes us unsafe. We need America first and stop giving money to foreign countries at the same time defending our social services programs.
494,What about the deportation question?

He wants to make it sound like it was Trump’s fault when we were in an international crisis that forced us to do so. I dislike Trump, but to say he was the one who raised unemployment by his initial policy plans is goofy."

591,is biden an up coming rapper or something?
592,Biden is a complete zombie!
593,"It’s just like watching two kids playing table tennis. Batting who did what and when across the table, with words,  Instead of a table tennis ball.  President Biden looks like he has had a slight stroke. He is actually answering each question and not answering with another question. He isn’t stupid at all. He is physically ILL. They are like two kids trying to gain points against one another. Personally I do think Donald Trump will be good for America!. He does know what he’s talking about. And does have planned strategies. He is an articulate and well educated man. He has to date been the ONLY PRESIDENT that has NOT gone to war!. And like Donald Trump said,  they are like two kids trying to compete against one another.  Which they actually are. Let’s face it,  President Biden isn’t going without a fight. Obviously since this programme was aired President Biden has stepped down. NOT of his own choice, but I believe he knows he is very poorly. And, because of this he should go now with his head held high. It’s NOT a sin to be ILL.  Keep bringing up Donald Trumps indiscretions is childish. He knows as well as we do what he’s done wrong. This maybe and I say maybe,  with caution that he is trying to put things right.  And I do agree with one thing whole heartedly if he should lose it has to be, because he has lost fair and square no funny business like before. You have to admire his tenacity for trying again. He is a strong willed man. Exceptionally intelligent too."
594,Oh let’s see the people who think project 2025 is real
595,I’m so happy at the amount of people I see voting for trump it actually feels like we are going to be alright ❤

610,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=725"">12:05</a> into this video Biden lost the election.

624,"Funny how they cut out trumps actual views on abortion, he said republicans want women who&#39;s lives are in danger or have been raped to have abortions, he&#39;s just opposed to abortions at 3rd trimester, rightfully so, are some American states really killing babies AFTER their born🤢🤮🤯"
625,As a Bangladeshi I think Joe Biden is more logical though he was mumbling or stammering in some cases.  Camala Harris chosen for next presidential election is wiser decision as a female candidate in American history !
626,Why they feel like AI ? So not real ?!!!<br>Out of the real world people

636,Abviously President  Biden has not done as well as he should have in the presidential debate. That&#39;s why I fully stand behind his decision to endorse vice President Harris as the new democratic nominee. I Believe she is undoubtedly well- equipped to beat Donald Trump in the coming election 🙏
637,Any indians attendance here👉
638,Poor Biden 😢 He is in the early stages of Dementia. It&#39;s blindingly obvious. I actually really feel for him. He has moments there where he truly looks humiliated and confused.

657,😂
658,THE IDEA
659,If they could pull the polls up or they would and show the levels everyone can see for their self in plain writing that Biden is wrong and line listen to The Numbers he&#39;s throwing out and also he thinks that people with believe that these things cause inflation and everything there is one thing that causes inflation and that is government spending so the money they are taken out of the government is causing everything else to go up because they are inflating the price look it up
660,I felt bad with our present and having a cold and probably on the verge of covid at that I really had to throw him off his game with Donald Trump acted like a civil human being. I know it was shocking to me. Just like everything else he just can&#39;t follow through poor Donald. You should pray for his soul
661,"Biden go back in ballot we will elect you,the reason trump economy risen was Covid-19 because there was no movement of people and goods!that made economic growth!if you elect trump this term you’ll see how worse will go 😢!biden did good job"

672,"The political process is no more a fight for rights of the  population,its a multi media marketing strategy,the media has more controll over the populations vote than the political ideology that was firstly there to serve the people and not just the middle class aristocracy 😂who are the aristocracy not the poor or the corporations but the media,justice system, gun laws,pen pushers,problem makers...create the  problem the gov/taxpayer will cover the cost and pay the bills,in house expliotation/corruption......<br><br>Blind beyond what you can see...."

674,I actually feel sorry for Biden. He has a look of confusion and sadness on his face. Hee is far too old and fragile to be up there. Poor guy. I&#39;m glad he stepped down. He left his run too late.
675,"U destroyed our economy so badly people can barely afford basic needs. Then gave all of our tax money to foreign nations instead of helping Americans.  No one is loving it here, no one. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN."

721,"As a european, i am watching this debate and i believe that nothing good is going to come from this election. Good that mr Bidan has made the decision to withdraw, i think you are going to have a better fight between  mr Trump and mrs Harris.<br><br>Why are all of these old people trying to rull the world? It&#39;s prety fun watching a man in his late 70&#39;s debate with another man in his early 80&#39;s about eachothers achievements and failures, but i beieve this kind of debate should be in a park in front of a chess table or something."
722,holy fack dude.... the dude on the right site bearly can talk .....
723,he was already planning to quit that&#39;s why Biden do not put any efforts in the debate
724,They treating this shi like the olympics 🤣
725,"Making an erroneous statement that groceries that once cost $100 a few years ago, now costs $120 shows you how the elite or the rich are far out of touch with reality.  And entrusting these people with our future is even more alarming."
726,If they both accuse each other of being a criminal how can either run for office. Is that why Biden stepped down?
727,We went straight to comments section 😊

730,All Biden can do is to lie and blame Trump to defend himself just to manipulate audience.
731,Booooo Trump!! How can America consider a criminal like Trump for President. He was convicted of offenses.
732,A movie on Donald Trump would be crazy. Who would play Trump that&#39;s the question.

735,Ripped holes through that corrupt ghost of a man
736,Yang comment tak setuju tu kebanyakan nyaa orang bukan negeri johor . Aku setuju je party Untuk negeri johor di dirikan .

748,"Why did Trump not seize on the opportunity to bring up the Ray Epps saga?  It would have been a slam-dunk. There is no way that you can deny that one. Ray Epps was on video cutting fences and telling (inciting) the crowd that &quot;they MUST breach the Capitol&quot;, yet the FBI absolutely refused to arrest him. Why? The only possible explanation is that Ray Epps is an FBI or CIA asset which means he was planted there to do what he did. When it&#39;s all on video, it&#39;s undeniable, so he should have been among the first to be convicted (he was arrested, but immediately released and taken off of the FBI Most Wanted list), yet there are still people rotting in jail just for being there, but Ray Epps, who was more prominent and actually displayed that he was an ORGANIZER, goes scot-free."
749,"I always learn so much from your videos, keep them coming!"

774,"So pretty much, It&#39;s a bunch of lying from both parties, but mostly Joe Biden trying to make other things he did be better than the loads of lying and things that he did wrong"
775,"This should be a drinking game.  Take a shot every time you hear &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;By the way&quot;, &quot;Period&quot;, &quot;Number 1, 2, etc...&quot;or any stutter or repetition"

792,Trump rite .
793,Epic poor performance from two very old men. <br><br>Fast forward and now it&#39;s one very old man and a much younger former prosecutor.

803,"Happens each time. They push for companies to pay more, So they cut jobs or move to Mexico. Once you get that raise, inflation takes it away. Newsom thought he was clever, but instead, places are closing. You can&#39;t just force companies to pay a lot more out and not expect prices to rise. Under Biden Administration, remember, day one he shut a large company down, sad"
804,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=710"">11:50</a> is what youre looking for"

817,"Biden needed to step down years ago. The way Biden has handled everything at every turn...I want a president that I trust to make some good decisions. <br>His pull out of Afghanistan, fun fact..Biden has never once publicly acknowledged that was a tragedy as we lost 13 brave Servicemen and women..he has called it all a success. Not once has Biden written these Gold Star families, not once has he agreed to meet with them, not once has he taken their phone calls. <br>Our fallen servicemen and women deserve to be honored and respected and so do their families. The way Biden has ignored these families, the way he has never admitted fault or accountability for those lost on August 26, 2021 is unacceptable."

829,The Democrats are real radicals on the abortion law. Trump is very radical with Immigration Law
830,Trump’s facial expressions are tearing me up. Every mumble that comes out of Biden’s mouth is torture to Trump’s ears.
831,Yes he stumbled a little bit but nowhere near as much or as bad as these people committing but I do agree with his decision to drop out of the race
832,hhahahhahahahahahahahahahahha

835,"There is, at least, one country in the world who has shown a growth on job offers during pandemics?"
836,I am extremely concerned about this. Trump is a liar I do not see how he changed from the last time he was in office then had legal problems and still on going and Bien cant remember anything and his speech is a massive problem plus he is up in age so that plays a big factor too.

To both of you target on the question without personal feelings.  If you feel  personal imputs are necessary, add it at the end after addressing the question first with factual recollections."
944,I hope the public is keeping track of poll #’s
945,Biden always sounds like he needs a pint of ice cold water 🥛💧. After watching this i really do wish D.T. becomes the President of the USA. More so after his last term and most definitely after Bidens mess of a Presidency.
946,This debate was an audition for Joe Biden to remain on the job and he failed.
947,Posible trump will wins soon
948,2020 debate was fun to watch...but this is sad

962,"With the drug pandemic man. Its has a lot to do with the state of pur country. All the dept, murder, amoung other things. Its a very sad thing to see and i dont blame people for looking for other ways to find relief. Or just plain giving up. Mental health is a huge part of that too. We just cant give up guys. Im only 22 and i dont want to be the generation that watches our world fall into a state of decay."
963,Biden himself does not have confidence in his points 😂😂😂

982,Biden Don&#39;t Go To Victims Funerals He Don&#39;t Care.
983,Trump is a businessman.  My husband is a commercial electrician with over 30 years experience and is licensed in multiple states- we are financially destitute and have a hard time paying for groceries- even with me growing a massive garden and putting up as much food as I can.  Why?!  Why can&#39;t we get a loan?  Why can&#39;t I pay my debts now?  What happened?  HELP SAVE US!!!!
984,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=5063"">1:24:23</a> <br>Trump: Lets not act like children<br>Biden: You are a child.<br><br>I found that hilarious"

990,JOE BIDEN FOREVER. DONALD TRUMP IS NO MORE. Trump will never know what he&#39;s talking about but Biden will always have the power.
991,Climate control?! Idk but hey clean water.
992,This is a presidential freestyle battle !
993,I skibidi with 😢
994,BIDEN DROPPED OUT LOL
995,"They don’t want that poisonous, fake, mucus forming food from us lol smh they are crazy"
996,"Am I the only one who noticed that when it came to speaking on black issues is the only time (so far) that he didn’t have enough to say and was reminded he’s got more time…. That didn’t happen on the other questions, feels like priorities are leaking through…. Doesn’t care about black wages is what it seems like to me!"
997,why are there kamala commercials over every trump related video? seems like google might be a little liberal
998,I can’t watch this guy for 2 mins
999,Biden destroy America
1000,I work for unemployment. This is a lie! There isn’t any jobs!
1001,Thumb will definitely win
1002,"When Biden said “hipuitabitta, hubtaph, whaphabuttapht” I really felt that"
1003,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=721"">12:01</a> Joe Biden sounds like a Zombie😭😭😭😭😭😭"
1004,"Age and time is against joe biden he did the right thing by dropping out of the presidential race, i am watching from Jamaica"
1005,Trump was right 😂
1006,Honestly joe Biden sounds congested but what he is saying is good- i really don’t know why  he was said to be so terrible in this debate
1007,And where did they get grocery only marked up 20 bucks. More like doubled!!!
1008,So two kids on a group project pointing fingers arguing who did what and nothing on real issues/change needing to take place. Grand. We have a lot of brilliant people in this country…. Why are they not running for president….
1009,After that i dont need to whatch any comedian show for at least one week 😂
1010,"I’ll be honest, unless you’re brainwashed into believing blue is the only way I don’t know how you could vote for Harris at this point. Minorities shouldn’t like her for her time working in law…see some of her work in that position. She acts very aggressive and rude, which don’t get me wrong Trump can also be guilty of as well, but it’s at least FUNNY when he does it. She much like Hillary, seemingly hates anyone that doesn’t agree with her and I doubt even many women would want to see her in office as having HER as the first woman president would almost guarantee we wouldn’t have another one given how little confidence she has instilled in the American people as a VP. I thank her for her time working as the VP of our nation, and I’m certain that not all of her efforts have been fruitless but honestly, taking away personal appearances what is there to like about her?"
1011,"Talking about porn 🌟, golf, an sucker and loser in a presidential debate is crazy work😂"
1012,I would rather have an old but wise  Biden to run any country  than a mad man with no manners.
1013,"You could see the difference of Joe Biden&#39;s performance in his presidential debate in 2024 as compared to almost ALL of his previous debates. Most people are not aware about biomedical biometric hacking,nanotechnology, brain machine interfaces, systems of internet of things, weaponization of everything etc. work that could affect the wellbeing of a mass or a targeted individual.  If you are not aware of the nature of these, you are not aware of how fragile and dangerous our world is has become."
1014,joe looks like he&#39;s stuck in a constant ww1 dramatic movie scene
1015,We all know why they added the rule to turn the mic on and off 💀
1016,"I’m disappointed, I really wanted to hear what they were going to say about lowering the daycare costs. I have 3 kids and going to work full time, me alone is not cutting it along with the high inflation rate."
1017,why do they talk like white  people don&#39;t matter or black/hispanics  are belittled?  Citizens are citizens. Why all the race?
1018,"Bidens face when he brings up the fact he called black people &quot;Super Predators&quot; in the 90&#39;s was a look of shock like he had a flashback to when he said it and only just remembered. 🤣<br><br>Sad this is the state of Politics in the US - An old man who must have more helpers than Santa and a Narcissist who can&#39;t accept defeat or be humble for a mistake on any level. IFfyou check the claims of both of the statements they make whether it&#39;s the Economy, Foreign affairs etc they&#39;re both hyperbolic to prop themselves up and punch the other one down, lying to themselves and the public."
1019,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1740"">29:00</a> biden got cooked here too bad the founding fathers aren&#39;t here they would sentence biden for treason"
1020,Wish harambe was on the ballot again
1021,"I’m not even American, and while I definitely was a big fan of Biden in 2020 I do particularly enjoy everyone unified over this debate performance being bad 😅"
1022,On the right a poor old man with a &quot;enthusiastic&quot; wife behind him; Take a look in history at Anna Eleanor Roosevelt.
1023,"he made biden drop out <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a>"
1024,Joe will drop out.
1025,I love US presidential debates even if I dont live there
1026,Trump said he really beat medicare to death😂😂
1027,"Why does everyone act like this is an embarrassment on both sides, Trump is sharp and articulate."
1028,"Seriously, Biden said if the rich pay 25% of their earnings to the gov could get us out of debt within 5 years!?!? Are you kidding me?!?!? Why should the rich pay for the gov messing up!?!? Gtfoh!!!"
1029,Just watching this on July 22 😅 hits different I imagine.
1030,“The idea” 😂
1031,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=949"">15:49</a> well said mr president 👏🏻"
1032,Trump❤❤❤❤
1033,"Biden saying the middle class was devastated by Trump….what a joke! Food and inflation has quadrupled under Biden.  Trump gave people more money take home in their paychecks. The interest rates on the housing market is out of control under Biden. Cars? No one talks about the increase of the price of cars since Biden in office. At first it was the aftermath of Covid bc of production shortages,  but that was 4 years ago. The price of cars is crazy how much they’ve gone up.  Everything more expensive and getting worse."
1034,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1280"">21:20</a>😂😂😂"
1035,"if trump saves the palestinians, I will support him too from now on."
1036,🎉
1037,"Trump:&quot;Who endorsed me for president, but i won&#39;t say that.. but they endorsed me for president&quot; is absolutely crazy 😂"
1038,Comprehensive spech expect.
1039,It’s ridiculous how far I had to scroll to find this after searching for the exact title .
1040,"If Biden win the election, the Great America will sleep, Biden needs to retired, he is so old, looks like he can even talk properly due to his old age. Is there any other young and energetic person to be a President candidate for both of the party, ..huizzzz....If i were an American, i will surely vote for Trump."
1041,Biden is a war criminal who will answer for everything
1042,Biden doesn&#39;t look healthy
1043,"Presidential debates should be fact checked on the spot, by a panel of 3."
1044,"And now this wannabe president dropped out, joe was the worst president in the history of America."
1045,I can not understand how anyone can discredit Mr. Donald Trump. He is the salvation of America!
1046,Everytime Joe Biden says the idea take a shot
1047,Joe mumble
1048,Biden doesn&#39;t even believe his own lies.. BIDEN RUINED AMERICA AND IS A LIAR AS TRUMP STATES...WE&#39;VE SEEN THESE THING COME TO PASS AND BIDEN STILL SAY&#39;S THEY AREN&#39;T TRUE WHAT A FARCE...
1049,My favourite comedy movie:- America 🇺🇸🏳️‍🌈
1050,Bring back Trump
1051,"This is very tough for Biden,  he looks very frustrating"
1052,"To make someone believe, first and foremost, speak clearly! and I don&#39;t think Joe Biden can do it. Thanks to Biden&#39;s speech in the debate, I have another materials for my students to practice English listening for their IELTS test!"
1053,&#39;&#39;and by the way&#39;&#39; ...
1054,who after biden resignation?
1055,The idea that Joe still think he&#39;s good fit for the job is shocking .
1056,Baiden is a fearoooooooo ……..this shows that Trump is already triumphant 🎉🎉🎉
1057,Trump thinking &quot;am I high&quot;?
1058,"Thee IDEAA that we found ourselves in a situation where, number 1☝️, We beat medicare, number 2, You’re the sucker You’re the loser number one…😕😞😞😞😪😴😪😞🙂‍↕️😯…. And by the way 😦"
1059,the question was.... its ridiculous how often thats said
1060,i say i dont believe woman should be in positions of high power because woman can be ridiculously emotional but boy thats all im seeing is emotions overpowering reasoning its crazy lets just keep putting eachother down with terrible insults instead of explaing in front of Americians why they should be the President of America
1061,shoot i dont like biden but at least hes somewhat answering the questions
1062,how are you gonna help americans in the throw of addiction that cant afford it???? its all joes fault its all trumps fault GREAT ANSWER YOU GUYS
1063,sooooo what about childcare????
1064,Leeeeeeeeeets geeeeeeettttt rrrreaaaaaady to <br>MMMMMMMMUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM LE 😂😅<br>😧
1065,they need to stop attacking each other and tell us why they should be the president answer the effin questions
1066,Biden made Trump look like a lot more eloquent than he actually is
1067,Biden whole time: <br>&quot;Hey that guy is cool i might vote for him&quot;
1068,Ok! President Biden is slow in talking but at least he is acknowledging and answering all questions! Trump is dodging all questions and just keeps blaming Biden for everything.  Jake and Dana did hold Trump focused on answering questions.
1069,The face of Donald Trump when Biden is speaking 😂
1070,Southwark gonna have a field day!😂😂😂😂
1071,THE IDEAL!!!!!
1072,Niether one addressed the cost of child care in reality!
1073,Who else is here after Biden dropping out?
1074,Trump doesn’t even know what Climate Change means! He didn’t answer the question!
1075,its like a couple boys fighting no ones answering the actual questions
1076,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=790"">13:10</a> Pro-life ❤ not pro-choice!!! We need Trump back in the White House to Make America Great Again. 𝗝𝗲𝘀𝘂𝘀 𝗟𝗼𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝗺𝗽 ✝️🙏🏾"
1077,"To all Americans, please vote for someone who at least has clear speech. I thought you&#39;re not supposed to come to a debate drunk. Biden, what!?"
1078,Looks like a rap battle between Eminem and Mumble rappers
1079,Trump never takes responsibility for his evil actions.
1080,Biden: we beat medcare Trump Yeah he beat it to death                                                 was funny not gonna lie lol🤣
1081,Trump doesn’t even answer the questions! Why? Because he’s the biggest liar.
1082,"Yes its true. All of our benefits, medication, SSI, housing, etc are all going to illegal immigrants that joe is allowing in with open borders"
1083,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1286"">21:26</a> he said &quot;I&#39;m going to continue to push until we get the full ban, full initiative, relative to what we can do with more border patrol and more asylum officers.&quot;  I dont see why people think this makes him soumd confused.  He&#39;s actually answering the question as asked, unlike Trump who uses every question as an excuse to rant off topic.  Yeah Trump sounds articulate while he&#39;s making stuff up, like saying that Biden opened the borders.  Its easy to find the words when you say whatever the heck sounds good to you.  Biden is carefully thinking of the accurate response and happened to stumble on one word.  In the context of a high pressure timed debate, someone stumbling on a word as they quickly decide which point to make in the moment is normal. I&#39;ll take unembelished honesty over articulate nonsense any day."
1084,Who is here because Joe Biden cancelled his plans for re-election
1085,Joe:... number one.....number two....number threee.......
1086,Biden talks just like Tinubu of Nigeria 🇳🇬<br>Could it be the &#39;B-factor?&#39;<br>Couldn&#39;t wrap my head around what he says
1087,"So according to Biden, only black families struggle with child care and home buying cost😅😅😅"
1088,And the problem isn’t biden. It’s the DNC platform AND the shadow people who are really running the country into the dirt and pulling this puppets strings.
1089,The idea
1090,Biden wasn’t the right guy in 2020. He’s never been the right guy. It was just his turn and they didn’t have anybody else so they stole it for him and installed him against America’s wishes. All you need to do is see his son Hunter to see what JB produced into our society. Father of the Year he’d never win.
1091,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=5065"">1:24:25</a>"
1092,Joe Biden is caudeling the black community for votes
1093,Let&#39;s see 900 billion dollars to Ukraine  from you the tax payers under Biden under Obama trillions to 13 wars more depth more death in history including more than ww1 ww2 combined.under Obama and record breaking inflation under Biden gas food real estate electricity disaster and his clean so called economy which is worst for enviroment than gas this Man just  like Trump said  a disaster

1099,Me tooo😅
1100,TRUMP🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
1101,I saw it for myself President Trump should have won the last election. I cannot imagine how it changed overnight. Where&#39;s the proof that it wasn&#39;t stolen? I don&#39;t see or hear anything about that.
1102,Who’s continuing to watch after Biden dropped?
1103,We need them to play a game of yugioh!
1104,This is what started the whole coup for the dems. They didn’t think he would do this debate. Trump 2024 🇺🇸
1105,"When it’s the turn for Trump and he starts grilling Joe, I look at Joe’s face and he looks very disturbed - I sympathize with him . Grilled Joe is gone !"
1106,"I agree that this is our last chance to change things around for the better. Making the right choice is the most important thing we have to face, right now more than ever!"
1107,"I love how the democrats in this comment section are trying to cope with the dementia patient of a president they &quot;voted in&quot; by acting like both did horrible during this debate and &quot;it&#39;s all a joke&quot;. Trump&#39;s absolutely destroyed Biden no contest, and he just proved on July 13th how much of a leader he truly is."
1108,Imagine if this kind of debate happens in india between former Pm and current Pm ☠️.
1109,Trump is the right guy.
1110,why joe why because we know what you are we know what runs rampant in dc and throughout the media and corps
1111,"This type of debates should be in our country also.<br>but our minister is coward. he is afraid of media conference, then its impossible to imagine that he would debate because he dont have guts to debate.<br>its our fault who is blind."
1112,"Trump should be able to make right what was done to him the way he was treated. I believe there are a lot of people being treated wrongly in the same similar ways. This is the cause for American division. We cannot allow this. There is so much more that is wrong going on and I hear one person talking about solutions and the other totally stuck on trash talking. I realize that this is a part of running for president, but I have never seen such ridiculousness."
1113,i worried biden will collapse in the middle of debate...he look not fit to be a  president and the whole world can watch it😂
1114,"I know about the homeless veterans. I met one. I know that lots of people ended up homeless because it was made possible when rent was so called not required to pay during covid. There was no recovering for them and lots of people went homeless. There&#39;s other things as well. Even now there&#39;s people dying from cancer and they are still trying to work to pay their bills and keep up their rent. A year ago this person owned their home and was doing well. Now that they are sick they spend their life alone sad and worried about getting through. Where&#39;s the help for someone in this place? He has worked in his life. He did his part. There is no program available to help him. At least not close to home, in Wisconsin."
1115,The debate that sunk the Biden campaign.
1116,NOW WE GET KAMALA V TRUMP DEBATE YESSSS🤣💀 Lets go Trump
1117,imagine a world where journalists did their job and people actually took them seriously
1118,"let&#39;s be frank, Biden&#39;s presidency was horrible for the us and the world"
1119,It’s Joever
1120,Everything just went downhill after Biden became a president.
1121,I’ll never forget how Tangerine Man handled Covid what a joke that was!
1122,Twice the cost of living.  TWICE
1123,"Two tacos at Jack n the Box used to be $1. Now it’s $1.99. Inflation has doubled!!  I won’t even get on my increase in car insurance (and I’m considered a senior at 55), and Starbucks. People in California are homeless because you can work at a job making $85,000 a year and still can’t afford rent or purchase a home."
1124,I didn&#39;t receive my tax money from Joe
1125,Yes trust Good job Trump
1126,Bruh biden speaks like a failed robot experiment

1129,I don&#39;t have my tax money
1130,This aged well
1131,"The Biden only one word to describe his performance, INCOMPETENCE 101. The Biden beat Medicaid."
1132,20 million views. Now what. Biden out
1133,“Canis mas macho.”In my Judge Milian voice.😂😂😂
1134,The beginning of the end...😔
1135,"I’m in tears… Biden really doesn’t look well. They should’ve never let him go up there. The man is obviously not 100%. No one on his team noticed what was going on?  I’m 55, and my thoughts are fleeting often, so I can just imagine what Biden is going through. Shame on the democrats!!!"
1136,Destroying our country. We all feel it!
1137,These comments are more entertaining than the greatest comedian. 😂😂😂
1138,"Brandon has no idea what&#39;s going on, surrounded by incompetent liars feeding him a fantasy story he isn&#39;t checking anything, won&#39;t watch news, gets talked to like a baby."
1139,"Biden, God sees you and your Conrad’s. <br>All your corrupt politicians. Keep lying. I pray you ask for forgiveness. Biden, you’re will in trouble. Gods wrath."
1140,He killed biden with this debate 😂 now biden is GONE AND GOOD RIDDANCE

1143,You know you are screwed when Trump makes more sense than Biden 😂
1144,Just fight each other already. !!! 2 old men !!!!! Trump will win
1145,I think Trump is fit for presidency than Joe. American should vote for the right person.
1146,I am watching this debate again after Biden dropped out. I was waiting for a second debate.  Too bad I can&#39;t watch it any longer. No more Trump Vs. Biden debate. Better than any reality show!!!
1147,"I’ve never heard of a politician that I trust, so for me, I go by results - <br>Under Trump, America had a strong economy, was prosperous and not involved in wars, and wokeism was nowhere near as rampant as it is now <br>Under Biden, America has descended into chaos (some states worse than others), we are seeing lawlessness, the economy is crumbling because people are being even more heavily taxed to fund overseas wars, cost of living has gone through the roof, America has become a laughing stock, and woke nonsense is rife <br>The proof is in the pudding……"
1148,Joe says he lost more jobs than gained during his presidency as if covid had nothing to do with that lol.
1149,15k new jobs is not much at all
1150,Joe Blieden is just 🤯. It&#39;s constant. Knock knock mutha fka

1154,"Everyone all around the world not just only think this Biden regime is weak, but all knows that Biden is the weakest ever known president of America in this history of this country"
1155,"Trump is cunning &amp; a smart guy. He turned himself a speaker of  rage, angst, hardship, helplessness, lost hope, lost dreams, hurt and pain of the people and they buy what he says, for it’s what they want to speak out themselves and what they want to hear. As a Christian it brings me to tears in what a mess  your country is and how the people suffer ! Yes ,  he does what none of those in charge „ up there“ have done ; right ? BUT:  The crisis is not ! Centred, nor focused solely on the US … it’s a WORLDWIDE one ; everywhere the exact same, disgraceful story going on.<br> Inflation of :<br>money, crime!, poverty, joblessness, cut offs, price explosions, frustration leading to  disbelief in policies, governments etc. Dearest Americans you are not alone in this! when you isolate from all the rest of us you will get worse problems than you already have. Trump is absolutely right in so many points, but wrong planet. ! It’s not Planet America. I cannot tell I dislike, nor disrespect him; my heart &amp; christian belief  restricts me from doing so  and I understand you the people absolutely… I am not! to judge, nor point fingers, but it needs more than just a good, flaming speech,  moving the masses and emotions. I am not an economist but we all know that economy is connected around the globe, we have a global economy ! Tightly woven together like the Gordian Knot! Every country wants to benefit…. and oh boy ! do we have many countries on this planet ! Ask yourselves What you‘ll do if  on the long run : maga going nada ? Who will you blaim?"

1232,Honestly cannot believe Biden got elected. I voted at my local voted center. I&#39;m a black Republican. Had my ticket number And my vote was lost in transit because I live in a swing state. I highly believe voter fraud occured and trump did win the 2020 election and that&#39;s why January 6th even happened in the first place.

1250,Its true that the other countries are seeing America as the best joke with Biden as president . Humiliating.
1251,If Trump gets back in office in 4 years will be right back where we started in a recession
1252,Trump is talking about Barack Obama&#39;s economy you can&#39;t take credit for the economy before you&#39;re sworn into office
1253,In what policies did Trump talk about none old Trump does is stand up there and lie
1254,Republicans like to make fun of Joe biden&#39;s debate but look at Ronald Reagan he had Alzheimer&#39;s for 2 years into the presidency

1266,"I&#39;m not American and have no horse in the race. But if any person thinks Biden is fit to be president, you need to seek psychiatric help."
1267,Sleepy Joe🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1268,non bias and Biden took the dub.. comments rigged 🥱 ez reads
1269,"Having watched <i>The Debate</i> for the first time, I don&#39;t know what all the fuss is about. Trump gave loads of exaggerations, while Biden gave statistics. Biden spoke like someone with so much more to say, providing the detail of what he had done, the benefits of it, and highlighting the international co-operation of which the USA has been the lead since 1945. While Trump just blamed domestic problems on immigrants coming across the border from prisons and mental institutions, and presumed current international crises could easily be resolved by the respect the World has for him. But Europe mocked Trump privately, as evidenced by the leak of diplomatic cables / reports, while Russia, China and NKorea merely massaged his ego with meetings while taking advantage of his worldly ignorance to continue their objectives. Hey ho!"
1270,"“Yea he’s a 6 handicap, that’s the biggest lie of them all” 😂😂😂.  How can anyone hate this man. Trump 2024"

1278,"Trump : I wish he was a great president , because I wouldn’t be here right now the only reason I’m here is because he’s so bad 😠<br><br>Me: 🫢<br><br><br>Biden:🤨"

1287,Biden can only talk good going against trump not for our president
1288,"Rewatching this affter the assassination attempt...... I notice this time around Trump is sharp. He has laser focus and is NOT shying away from serving up the truth however it comes out.. it&#39;s a passionate tone, a patriotic attitude towards injustice to our nation. <br><br>TRUMP 2024 ALL THE WAY."
1289,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=378"">6:18</a>🤣 great job by not spreading germs! He almost covered his whole face!! Wow! Amazing!!🤣🤣🤣🤣"
1290,All of that money spent on other countries 😢 While we are struggling in the USA !  Trump is a business Man ! He got the job done ! His strong &amp; brave 💪 He will make America great again! He will send us more money to the American people either by check or when we file taxes ! I can&#39;t wait ! Trump is not a popet like Biden ! So called Dr .

1293,Mr Biden your sponsoring a war in Ukraine
1294,Let’s be honest… price gouging is the problem not the economy yall…. “Oh it’s inflation!!” Ummm no there is no data to support this.
1295,At times Trump was almost gracious to Joe. He felt compassion for his sad situation. Joe Biden’s family and close circle should be ASHAMED for parading him around and abusing him like this. <br><br>AMERICA IS CRIPPLED with this bogus administration in charge. Do you know they haven’t had a full Cabinet meeting since October 2023?! His inner circle was trying to shield Biden’s  cabinet to attempt to hide his condition. DOWN WITH THE DIRTY ELITE POLITICIANS! Rise up America!
1296,"Gonna say this. AMERICA, STOP VOTING FOR AGED MEN! THERE&#39;S A REASON WHY THE AGE FOR PRESIDENCY IS 36!"
1297,I&#39;d really love to see Epic Rap Battles of History do a Trump vs. Biden. My inability to understand a word Sleepy Joe says would go right along with my inability to understand rap.
1298,Biden can&#39;t even talk. Take him out of office. Also fire director of secret service
1299,&quot;He&#39;s giving 200 billion dollars on Ukraine.&quot; <br><br>NO WONDER EVERYTHING&#39;S EXPENSIVE
1300,"Biden, much better than CONVICTED CRIMINAL?   Duh"
1301,"Remember when Biden visited a veteran who lost his arm and instead of thanking the soldier he said, &quot;What do you want?&quot; <br><br>Or when he told a construction worker, &quot;I work for myself.&quot; <br><br>VOTE TRUMP 🇺🇸"
1302,The idea!!!
1303,I&#39;m just wondering what people outside of America think of this 💀
1304,<b>Americans:</b><br>🔴Trump VS Biden🔵<br><br><b>Rest of the World:</b><br>We&#39;re so doomed..!

1311,"The illegal immigrant isn&#39;t taking your job, Joe. One gave you your job"
1312,"And, by the way. .. the idea that.. and the other thing is ..."
1313,"Trump is begging for money from his followers, yet he can&#39;t pay his own bills. <br><br>Trump will lose.  There&#39;s no way Americans will elect this guy."
1314,"Biden just need retirement, USA is too huge for him to handle"
1315,This female presenter sounds a bit racist with all those stats about black folks. Shame on her.
1316,💀
1317,Millions of people ! Millions!! And we only got 2 senior citizen nominees???<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂
1318,"If trump doesnt win, im going back to mexico"
1319,Biden ended pipeline jobs the first day wheres the solar panels Joe? We want the billions of dolars back from the semiconductor plant. Wheres the semiconductors ?<br>Paul pelosi may have that money since he invested in it secretly or how bout the money from the immigrant hotels nevermind just kidding if the media says it believe it
1320,If i hear one more time an answer starting with &quot;The idea...&quot; idk what ill do..
1321,Biden if you don’t think we have the greatest economy. Step down and sit down. Biden’s only priority is illegal immigrants
1322,I wish Biden wore a voice changer box or Darth Vader mask when he talked. Like nails on a chalkboard listening to him.
1323,Number 1 number 2 what a liar
1324,Watching instead of a thriller on Netflix. Do not regret it.
1325,"Dear Mr Josef Biden: Mr Putin says in his interview that Mr Putin prefers Josef Biden as the president of USA. But Russia is not meddling the US elections. What we had with Mr Hodorkovsky?  I remind you that USA supported a billioner Mr Hodorkovsky who was a citizen of Russia. USA wanted him to become a President of Russia. What we have now? USA supported  Mr Navalny who insulted Mr Putin saying that Mr Putin is a robber and murderer. USA blamed a death of Mr Navalny on Mr Putin. What we have now? An attempt to assassinate Mr Robert Fico of Slovakia and later an attempt to assassinate Mr Trump. Why Mr Biden is so afraid of opposition? And who is really a murderer? Nevertheless, personally, I respect for you as a father who, despite all mass media shows about your son Hunter, remains proud of your son Hunter. You are excellent father! But my former Boss Boris brought up his excellent daughter who will never be Maria Magdalena. And what we have now? Zelensky has become  Maria Magdalena, Navalny became  Maria Magdalena . Who is the next to become Maria Magdalena?"
1326,Any candidates who dodged a question. Did so by use of posponments. Did so to get something ready for later.  Then grinned. But did so really expressivly. Then decided and did return to what he wanted to be focused on (hearing himself say that hey wanted). If they did all of that without any visible help on all or most questions. Both lose the debate. But we all lose out on honesty from both on this televised event and tax payors will help them do their stuff too.
1327,It&#39;s incredible that Biden is only 3 years older than Trump.
1328,I love these comments
1329,"&quot;The only existenital threat to humanity, is climate change&quot; Has biden lost the plot completely? It is clearly nuclear arms and war. Sheesh. Wasting all this money on high cost low benefit climate policies, it is unintelligent."
1330,"Trump: Yeah, he was right, he finally beat medicare - he beat it to death🤣🤣🤣<br><br>Am not American, but I follow up most of the activities of her government , and I can say for sure, Biden&#39;s administration is ......... let me hold my peace"

1333,“Covid- I skibidi with. — Joe Biden 2024
1334,The look that Bidens’ giving Trump is completely revealing. The truth will set you free!! Never in my life have I been subjected to this type of immature ramblings which are regrettably coming from an actual Presidential debate.
1335,"Trump&#39;s way of saying things is way better than Biden&#39;s, he&#39;s incredibly charismatic, but Biden is saying way better things...<br>(I&#39;m Dutch and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, republicans please don&#39;t get angry!!!)"
1336,I cannot believe that Biden is even considered for another 4 years.

1338,I like the confidence of trump and his free face.
1339,US is such a laughing stock
1340,Stop Biden&#39;s madness ... he&#39;s not a President. <br>He is a liar !!!
1341,Everyone seems to be overblowing how much Biden messed up. He definitely stumbled over words but he only messed up his thoughts twice in the first 20 mins. The rest of his dialouge was easy to follow
1342,What kind of leadership now a day&#39;s world producing 😂 😂
1343,Why do we have ads for 3 mins then give a president 60 seconds to discuss big issues pathetic
1344,Trump is the men for this Job🙏🔥👍
1345,"Try leaving a comment w ANYTHING in it being even remotely critical about Biden, and absolutely dont be vulgar or rude.

THEN, go back try and editting, or look for it through another accoint.

Trump started the building of the border wall so that he could also influence building border walls around the entire United States, that&#39;s his intention.  <br>Where does Trump &quot;think&quot; those who are desperate to enter the U.S., are going to go if the border wall was completed?<br>Entering the U.S., will heighten from Florida.  Trump&#39;s mindset is to plan by destructive dictatorship to rule our nation and not by American governorship."
1348,Biden boasting about killing babies. Crazy
1349,"as someone from scotland makes me curious, what is the main difference for working class people under each of these 2?"
1350,"Biden looks weird when he not speaking, but then he speaks and it really gets werid 😂"
1351,Biden says all this but had 4 years and did absolutely nothing he stated. In fact he did the complete opposite and everything he says are straight lies. Basically what Biden says think the opposite
1352,"Brandon, go speak to them. Who missed that?"
1353,"Biden is repteloid or whatever civilization is in his avatar. His eyes are robotic weirdly shining out of the contour of the eyes.

1359,"Not a single thing biden says makes sense. Much of his utterances literally are not even words. I wouldn&#39;t elect or trust this guy to be my janitor, yet, SOMEHOW, apparently, millions of people elected him to rub the biggest and most powerful country on Earth. This proves to me that,  yeah, Biden&#39;s got some huge problems, deficiency, etc: absolutely. However, people in general, especially Americans clearly have an actually much bigger problem than Biden, and WE are the biggest problem &amp; threat to ourselves. Wake up. Snap out of it, cuz they have no problem snapping it 4 u"
1360,"Biden is reptiloid or whatever civilization is in his avatar. His eyes are robotic sparkling weirdly, the way he closes his eyes and speaks in the stream whatever they&#39;re streaming to him, scary <br>No wonder popular numerologist said he is fulfilling his mission of evil on Earth"

1434,"They’re both as bad as each other, Trump lies through his teeth and speaks confidently<br>Biden speaks truth but can’t get a solid word out and sounds like he’s on deaths door."
1435,America and Biden seems to forget that back when Trump won he declared he would not be taking the salary to be president because he’s already rich and that he didn’t feel right having taxpayers pay his salary. So he did not get paid for his presidency. <br><br>And the fact he said he wants clean water I can get behind that I just wish for once a president would talk about how they will help our wildlife and our animals of the country/world. Tougher laws tougher penalties for animal abuse over breeding  etc etc and for invading in wildlife spaces.
1436,The Idea! The Idea! The Idea! The Idea! I know almost nothing about United States politics because im from Argentina and my english vocabulary is not extensive but I found the repetition of the starting phrase: &quot;The Idea&quot; kind of annoying so to speak. Can someone give a dictionary to Biden please so he can start his phrases with something else rather than saying The Idea for the tenth time?<br>Also I dont understand what Biden finds funny about anything in a country&#39;s adminsitration. He keeps laughing everytime Trump says something about him he laughs. Why is he laughing? Are politics funny?
1437,"American politics is so weird, what’s with the fkn battle music when they walked in"
1438,Biden is such a corrupt liar
1439,Trump is trying so hard not to crack up laughing😂😂😂 his facial expressions when Biden stumbles on his words is sending me 🤣🤣🤣😩
1440,Is Biden even talking or just breathing heavily? <br><br>Had to turn on CC to know what he said...
1441,"Trump not  answering questions, improvising, basically a joke considering hes running for a president. biden is old, nothing to say about that"
1442,We await the 2nd presidential debate. Will the United States of America be better with Joe Biden in another 4 year term? What will the Nations solutions be ? The Presidential election is close   And fair. We want democracy and we want justice.
1443,Donald is like 20hp and Biden is 1😹😹
1444,"The idea, the idea, the idea."

1447,Biden :-0
1448,So will trump be debating someone new now lol

1452,Unbelievable that more than half of America voted for (sleepy Joe) Bieden over Donald J. Trump.
1453,Can&#39;t believe WSJ left the comments unlocked on this one
1454,Donald Trump a president then he&#39;s going to try to come back into the run Trump will be president next year next time
1455,"Biden is misinformed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=5257"">1:27:37</a> ! This is another reason why I think he shows signs of dementia, its no way he can possibly think it Trump will be easy to beat  coming election,its just the opposite! Biden seem to be in orbit and were on earth! Biden seem to be struggling  to stay focus! No way he can think after this debate ,he&#39;ll win ! Even before the debate, he was loosing, now he has lost!"
1456,The difference between 2020 Biden and 2024 Biden… shocking. That is a massive decline.
1457,"I seen a old lady in the grocery store she said the prices are so high since Biden  became president and opened up the border! She only  getting  $23.00. In snap food allowance, and when Trump was president she was getting $293.00 ,she also said she has a special diet being a diabetic,it Cost more to eat, and can&#39;t afford to buy a new fan even, It broke my heart! I went and got her 2fans! Biden is a liar and made it harder for blacks and Latinos too ,who is definitely voting for Trump2024. I dare you Biden taking away from our elderly, and giving undocumented illegal migrants and allows the undocumented illegal migrants to live better even than our American elderlies,and being proud of it! Word get around ,guess what Biden your not our choice the most of us blacks and Latinos are voting for TRUMP 2024."
1458,"Trump has no real answers to any of the very real problems... all he does is deflect and blame. ugh Biden&#39;s right, he&#39;s a whiner"

1534,"It’s clear as day who still has more professionalism, class, and a brain in his head, even though he’s very old and sluggish now. Trump makes a broad statement, says it’s a fact and idiots agree"
1535,I actually can’t believe the US is an actual country😭

1540,Trump is so energetic! Trump is going to have the Victori in 2024. We want a candidate who Protect aur  Country ......
1541,Biden speaks like when I started to 😮sleep.
1542,"i was doing good with medicaid and medicare until Biden came in. I ended up now having to pay for my medicare like I said before. i bought a home when I was working. When I became disabled my my house payment was still $780, My Disability is $865 and they started taking $175 out of my check for Medicare part B.  So do I keep my house or my Medical insurance through Medicare....Hmmm. Let me think!!!!"
1543,Immigration is a problem there is a spot which is what used to be cps building is now housing hundreds of new immigrants every 2 weeks they getting sent all over the country and in the day time there on the streets infront of the stores restaurant asking for money ans clothes its sad what biden is doing to this country and its true what trump is saying there all getting socials with benefits ridiculous
1544,Uh..no offense but white families are suffering also.  😢😢😢
1545,OMG this level of arguments are just embarrassing 😂
1546,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2795"">46:35</a>"
1547,Speaking of SOcial Security. My house payment is $780 and I only get $865 on Disability and was denied my widows benefits because I didn&#39;t become disabled until 7 months past the statute of limitations for receiving widows benefits. I fought for 6 1/2 yrs before that just to get my disability. That is the short story.
1548,Biden just looks like he has a &quot;michael meyers&quot; mask on everytime he looks at trump like 😦
1549,没有神的时代选谁都一样
1550,When i heard 1000 trillianares😂
1551,"ive got to say this i feel like a lot of gen z got swayed away from trump bc of the social issues and propaganda. I myself was a lot more left than i am now but i say i am more independent. But now i am able to see. Yes i believe in equal rights but not at the cost of our economy and civilization. And a lot of the social issues on the lefts go to the extremes. Like no one is going to take gay marriage away and i don&#39;t believe they are like taking away surgeries and duch from trans people. But the far left wants to let children get gender reassignment surgeries and allow for people to get abortions full term while trump saying the states get to vote on it which is thf people getting to vote and get there say on it. He also conpletely opened the border while people can just come into the country by completely thr immigration process and having a background check. thats my example of them going to the extremes. We can all live together in peace together but biden prase on these issues and it at one point got an emotional reaction out of people. But more people are starting to understand that he is even too far left for the leftists. Im not far left or far right. But trump is not taking rights away he obviously gave the choice to the people which has always been. Biden has failed this country. He is in his little pampered bubble and doesn&#39;t see how it is. My family can barely afford groceries at some points but cant get on social security or food stamps while illegal immigrants can. More of my friends and family are either liw income or lower middle class and we are struggling really bad and can barely afford to eat. I am young and not sure if im still able to register to vote bc i turn 18 three days before the election but if you&#39;re in the your in the younger generation like me and are feeling unsure or stuck in the middle please listen to the points i just made. Trump can all around fix our economy. Please vote. If not trump then robert kennedy jr who wouldve be my first choice. His points are really good he talks about real issues in health care, economy, mental health, ect. Im scared that ww3 is going to come quickly if biden gets relected and my brothers, cousins, and bf are going to be drafted maybe even myself since there is talk about women being drafted as well. Im not the most effective communicator but i hope i got my point accross to even one person."
1552,Even with the first question I&#39;m at 5 minutes and 37 seconds. It really does appear that there was a bias where Joe Biden may have been given the questions because his answers sound a lot more prepared and scripted.
1553,I dont understand this biden guy who is he
1554,They both bypassed the child care issue 😂🙄🙄
1555,PERIOD 😒
1556,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1342"">22:22</a> he&#39;s lookin around like &quot;y-y-y&#39;all hear this..?&quot;"
1557,this is what i imagine when bitlife gives you the &quot;be downright nasty to him&quot; option in a campaign.
1558,I’d love to be president one day
1559,I also have a Sagittarius moon sign like trump. The moon sign controls your feelings so I know how he feels
1560,Haha there’s no friendship here and it’s not cool with me they are the leaders of the world and can’t get along. Hello guys? Joey donny we gotta get along first we can’t do anything without squashing this beef.
1561,Rfk jr !!!!!
1562,Donald Trump is the realest of all presidents that&#39;s why they trying to take him out he fixed everything they don&#39;t want it fixed they want us to struggle and make all us stay living check to check

1582,"I&#39;m so tired of the Charlottesville stuff.

You can look up the full clip."

There has to be something more.<br><br>Also this was a “don’t vote for him” instead of a “vote for me” debate.

1620,Biden dating baby sitter
1621,"Strong, loyal presidents of the homeland no longer exist. Most of today’s leaders, led by President Joe Biden, are concerned with winning the White House, even if the price is very high and at the expense of the values ​​and principles approved by the Founding Fathers. Unfortunately, America has reached the top of the curve and is accelerating towards collapse. The main reason is the current leaders’ sacrifice of authentic American principles and values. They are desperate to appease homosexuals, and this is a violation of normal human nature. As an Arab Muslim, I do not want the United States to collapse. Moral failure and doing what the people of Lot did would anger God. Although America stands with the oppressors, it remains an important and pivotal country that contributes to achieving the global struggle and achieving relative stability for the world.<br>God said:<br>Were it not for Allah’s repelling people, some by means of others, the earth would have gone to ruin. But Allah is gracious towards humanity.<br><br>And God Almighty said:<br><br> Were it not for Allah’s repelling people, some by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, where Allah’s Name is commemorated much, would have been demolished. Allah supports those who stand up for Him. Allah is Strong, Honorable."

1641,Love how Trump said Biden doesn’t want it to be this way but he just doesn’t know. I’ve never felt like Biden had a grasp on any real issues. Even back when he was VP all he spouted was nonsense and buzz phrases. I can actually follow and understand what Trump says.

1693,Us Veterans are worse off actually... Thanks Biden...
1694,I&#39;ve been flicking back and forth between this debate and the first presidential debate of the 2020 election. Biden is a shadow of his former self.
1695,Here&#39;s the deal 😂😂😂
1696,"I work intermodal under trump and Biden presidency . I can tell you for a fact American was great under trump . The rail road was moving product across the country the international business was booming the economy was beautiful Americans could live comfortably !!! As soon as Biden went to office, I struggled to live working for the rail road and the product I used to move cut in half I struggle to live for 4 year working intermodal because of Biden !!! Fjb"

1698,Im suposed to vote for these 2? I dont have any other options??? This country cant be divided by 2 people... thats not possible US citizens are either all for one or all for the other... why do we only have 2 options? Where im from we have like 10 and they all come close in the results. Not 49% biden 47% trump and 3% for the other 8 candidates....

1701,Donald Duck is the biggest con man ever lol. Anything negative about him he just dismissed it as fake news.
1702,Ughhhh...  I dunno man this was a mess on both sides.  I get what everyone is memeing about Biden clearly is showing his age.  If you compare this to him in 2008 the difference is shocking but Trump also couldn&#39;t stay on topic to save his life.  I mean I swear rather than answering his questions over half the time he was pointing a metaphorical finger a Biden.  I just want to see questions Actually answered and not some finger pointing clown show.  This is an embarrassing display from what is supposed to be the 2 best candidates to lead the free world...   I&#39;ve lived under both of their presidency and as far as I&#39;m concerned things have gotten nothing but more difficult for me and the people who live around me over the last 8 years.
1703,As far as medical insurance goes Biden is full of it. My 20% deductible for my meds is more than my SSI check all together so now I&#39;m living in borrowed time.

1796,The only liar here is trump😂
1797,FJB!  Go to an old folks home buddy.
1798,trump just says the same thing over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and again
1799,Extremely boring and infantile debate.
1800,Both suck but trumps better
1801,I got a pay raise before covid to stay with my job it was only $3.50 raise per hour but everything in the store went up 2 - 5 dollars per item so basically the hard work I put in to get a raise is completely gone. I honestly haven&#39;t struggled with bills ever up until the past few years. I thought covid was over for the most part why are we paying these insane prices multiple years later and its only getting worse every time I go to the store the same item that was $4.69 is now $5.29  just a month later and it keeps creeping up every 1 - 3 months I&#39;m not paying $7  for a bag of doritos anymore I like them but come on.
1802,TRUMP 2024 may god bless America

1807,Tremendous
1808,"Using Biden&#39;s own words, words he used in every comment.  &quot;The Idea&quot; that he could be re-elected is frightening."
1809,trump cooked
1810,How Biden be a prisedent? I&#39;m try to imagination all people vote to him to be that one💀
1811,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1294"">21:34</a> Biden really tried his best to not cry"
1812,"It&#39;s funny how he compares himself to FDR and says he&#39;s done more than any other president in a while.  <br><br>People loved FDR , he lead his country through  the greatest war in history.  He got the US out of the great depression. The ego on Biden is tremendous.  Not to mention, no one questioned FDR cognitive abilities, and he he had the support of his party."
1813,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1292"">21:32</a> that&#39;s why you came for"

1816,Biden speaks like winston cherchil
1817,The part where sleepy joe is mumbling his words and Trump responds with I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence and I don’t think he knows what he said either about killed me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1818,Trump: Spitting facts...<br>Biden: Its a lie 😯
1819,"Okay, after watching 80% of the debate, I have to be honest. Biden isn&#39;t the same like the last debate, it&#39;s like he&#39;s a different man. I know he&#39;s grown older but my God that man can&#39;t be able to lead America. May the best man for the Americans win though"
1820,"Bro the look on biden face <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1010"">16:50</a>"
1821,Why does Biden always look so lost and confused when he not talking?!
1822,How did Biden convince the &quot;Great&quot; americans to be the 46th.... the fella is just whispering... is he unwell?
1823,Where is kennedy?
1824,Biden really is a good person TikTok and such platforms have brainwashed y’all to think trump is good
1825,"Well I don’t keep up with politics much, but I know one fact that’s true. Me and my family were a whole lot better off in the 4 years trump was president than these last four years. It’s a shame COVID happened toward the end of trumps time, bc it seems like everything Covid caused, they’re trying to use as an excuse for everything going bad like it’s bc of trump and not Covid. Idk all the facts, but I know my situation and that of everyone I know was better off before Biden."
1826,Social media has trump washed these ppl
1827,Trump would spend more time talking s*it abt Biden then him answering the question 😂
1828,Trump once said hitler had good ideas this man is crazy
1829,This debate is based on social media ppl make biden look bad when he actually says some truthful things
1830,Why USA&#39;s elections interest me even more than my own country&#39;s ones?
1831,Two old granny fighting  for coconut 🥥. One got milk out and one went to  doctor
1832,We finally BEAT Medicare!
1833,I never had COVID
1834,It is jover
1835,Trump: 🗿<br>Biden: 😧
1836,You can see even the news anchor were having a hard time keeping a straight face
1837,"You MUST APOLOGIZE TO TRUMP, biden... YOU are THE LIAR! (who doesn&#39;t blink) Is this the new AI rollout? I cannot NOT BLINK with biden - it was unbelievable - TRY TO NOT blink!"
1838,Trump responds to Bidens more than he answers the questions put to him...
1839,"Trump is crisp and clear, but he talks only about himself. Biden is like a sleepwalker or a robot when he is talking about important things, as if he is talking about someone else and is not convincing. Is this the world&#39;s leading U.S. presidential election debate? I have nothing but disillusionment."
1840,Where tf am I??- bidens thoughts
1841,"Okay but that is the issue. We have to worry about our country, for example your family is falling apart but you step out to help another family falling apart which we had no involvement in. Saddest part our generation is fixing it when it’s NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY, we didn’t sign up for this. Therefore it’s not fair for us, we can’t even afford a living without having 3 jobs and 10x more stress. So yes we’re going stand up for our rights too."

1868,joe: hey how are you?
1869,😂 Biden is speechless trump 2024
1870,TRUMP GOT THIS 🇺🇸🇺🇸
1871,"Jo seems like AI, for sure 🗿"
1872,Biden seriously listed Trump&#39;s $2TRILLION tax cut as a <b><i>NEGATIVE</i></b> for America.<br>Couldn&#39;t even imagine how embarrassing it must feel to wake up knowing you voted for that guy.
1873,funniest bit is when they ask trump a question and he goes straight for biden the whole minute 😂😂 bro forgot about the question
1874,Trump seems more woke and seems to know exactly what he&#39;s talking about but Biden just seems like a puppet
1875,"Trump&#39;s like a broken record; you already know what he&#39;s gonna say: we had the greatest everything when I was president. There were no problems whatsoever except for China, Mexico, Afghanistan, but we were so strong."
1876,Biden 🤡
1877,Are those 2 pensionados the best US have to offer?
1878,Get it right… A basket of groceries that costed $100 costs $200 now. Gas was $2 a gallon and now it’s $5 a gallon….
1879,None of them make sense this country everyone is an immigrant the real Americans who should run for the presidency are red indians it’s time to give them back their country
1880,"Grandpa Biden cant even talk well. All jokes aside, he really needs to retire now."
1881,So this technically is a blame game huh.
1882,"&quot;bro say sikibidi toilet&quot; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=710"">11:50</a> covid...I skibi di  with..."
1883,Sorry I cant watch this again!!
1884,"Donald Trump the best President, weeh no jokes on the point"
1885,Bidens cabinet has been lying to him!!
1886,All of America has just these 2 candidates... wow... Probably a small country and not many people in it.
1887,FJB! Makes me sick.
1888,I see fear in Biden&#39;s eyes whenever Trump speaks...
1889,Awesome Debate!
1890,"I think trumps stomach made a squelching noise at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4585"">1:16:25</a> 😂😂😂"
1891,Biden is so dumb he doesnt even notice that belarus is allies with Russia...
1892,What blows my mind is that the press had the authority to tell the &quot;most powerful people in the world&quot; when to talk/shut up. Wow!!! Now you know who owns the world we live in...
1893,God please let Trump win! We need a change. People need God!🙏🏽
1894,This is a joke
1895,Bleach ????
1896,Jesus Loves you all
1897,Think of Barack Obama when he died what he said about America.<br>Ann martin ruper a king
1898,Just remembered that song trump that says we&#39;ll make america great again
1899,Hey you now that this prin should that he show you  his name is Damen
1900,Watching this debate remind me of Tom and Jerry 😂
1901,President Biden: “uhhhh I skibidi with…” 😂
1902,Dot you mean Trump starts lying 🤥
1903,Guts and gaits
1904,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1294"">21:34</a> Game, set, match"
1905,"Next up, the C.I.A blessed N.A.S.A with A why can&#39;t touch, grass up hours? Newsflash honeycup, who made notchow tea? Gnaw sugar sugar wanna be the only one? Baicu"
1906,biden is talking like he reads the explenations really specifically for example:<br>&#39;&#39;Nr. 1 blah blah blah<br> Nr2. bla bla bla<br> Nr.3 bla bla period period period blah&#39;&#39;
1907,Is there someone who actually plans to vote for Biden again??
1908,"Jesus, why is this isn`t an every year show? The most fun and entertaining piece of elders talk i ever seen."
1909,It is so funny that Trump thinks he&#39;s your Messiah 😂and Putin would have not invaded Ukraine...what planet does he live on ?
1910,"JESUS CHRIST IS KING❤<br><br>Repent and accept Jesus Christ as you’re Lord and savior and follow Him . Deny your flesh and flee from the desires of this world . <br><br>“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”<br>‭‭John‬ ‭3‬:‭16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬"
1911,Watching this from Germany I feel sorry for you Americans to have the choice between these two. But it&#39;s good slapstick.
1912,Gooooo TRUMP
1913,People who always mention that they have a lot of friends don&#39;t have a single true one. And they know it.
1914,That was for. Four biden
1915,That was for
1916,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1369"">22:49</a> That stutter got me rolling 😂😂😂"
1917,President Trump doesn&#39;t reply the exact question he just run out of bush
1918,Despite Trump is a xenophobe but nevertheless during his reign there was peace all around in the world
1919,🙏🏻🤝🏻✊🏻
1920,"Parenzo, sei senza vergogna."
1921,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3742"">1:02:22</a> The only thing Trump was wrong about was the climate; I remember it snowing overnight and melting by afternoon from being so warm"
1922,It is undeniable in every corner of the internet the overwhelming support for trump (97%+) very few of you Biden supporters. I read through every single one of the thousands of comments and there are very very few of you.
1923,Anyone else see Joe Biden eyes shifting and moving or I’m tweaking ?
1924,This Trump guy might make a good President
1925,"i dont support trump, but biden just cannot be president"
1926,"Trumb is my man..witty lovable funny guy, who can lift america..its a last chance.."
1927,I laughed so hard when the anchor said there will be no audience and yet Biden waived to a non existent crowd. 😂
1928,Joe Biden the whole time when Trump was speaking :😮🙂😓🙃😔🥺🥺🥺😬😑🤔😒🤨😂😂
1929,Amen
1930,Amen
1931,NOW BIDEN NEEDS TO GET AWAY FROM THE SOFT DEBATE HE HAD LAST TIME HE TOTALLY BLEW. HAVE A NO HOLDS BARRED DEBATE AND SEE WHERE THEY GO????
1932,They both are here human ..but Biden tried and now we need more strength and the economy has to go up something has to start going right it&#39;s not easy to run a whole country. I feel everyone had a chance
1933,Whats the age of retirement again?
1934,&#39;Biden migrant crime😂&#39;that was literally so true
1935,"*Some youtubers say Americans are in touch with Aliens. <br>After watching Biden today, i believe it. He speaks alien language.*"
1936,Who&#39;s fact checking all these claims? Or is it okay to just throw around these claims to look good?
1937,PERHAPS..BIDEN SHOULD TAKE À COMPLETE REST..I CAN NO MORE HEAR CLEARLY WHAT HE IS SAYING..HÉ LOOKS VERY XHAUSTED BEING THE ÚS PRES..POOR AMERICA HVING THAT WEAK PRES...
1938,"&quot;They call it migrant crime, I call it Biden migrant crime&quot;.. this cracked me up"
1939,As an European im literally shocked. Seeing this debate was a quite weird experience. You can clearly tell which of these men is talking honestly and which one has (tried to) memorise the text he was supposed to say. What a distopian world we live in today..
1940,This is something else. That is such a comedy but at the same time a horror movie because how can they choose out of 300 mil people ppl like that for free world leaders.
1941,Trump is hilarious 😂 trump 2024!
1942,Its so funny 🤣🤣 I feel like this is not a debate I guess a comedy 😂😂
1943,Notice bidens face looks like a mask to be honest
1944,Biden
1945,"the drugs is from mexican cartel in mexico, thats why many illegal imigrants cross the border of US because many drug lords in mexico they extort their mexican people"
1946,lol
1947,Is Biden suffering from Amnesia?
1948,You 1st said as president.  That you were from Ohio.
1949,this could be straight out of south park!
1950,i genuinely believe this video has given someone a stroke by just watching it
1951,Biden just saying anything he can think of 😂😂
1952,This 1.3 hrs is a waste of time and air space. Clearly they have no plan for the increase of day care because they couldn’t answer the question. They’re children
1953,I still don’t get how Biden became President
1954,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1141"">19:01</a>"
1955,lol “and then he comes in and now we’re all laughed at like a bunch of stupid people”<br>lol it is true America is a laughing stock
1956,My message to Trump is &quot; you are the best US president ever and you are winning again&quot;... More love all the way from zambia
1957,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3848"">1:04:08</a>"
1958,I wish this debate was Julius Malema Vs Cyril Ramaphosa in RSA.
1959,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3844"">1:04:04</a> lol Biden&#39;s reaction 😂"
1960,Donald Trump is for better than Jo Biden for the development of the people of USA
1961,Stand up comedy these days 😂😅
1962,why are they not answering the questions??? they’re just arguing. this is shameful
1963,Who&#39;s lying here?
1964,I feel bad for Biden poor guy can barely put a sentence together. I wonder if he still has any reading/writing comprehension skills left? Just that thought alone should ensure that Trump is just logically elected. Peacefully and patriotically.
1965,what is their policy on the aging population and retirement age?
1966,Never forget ashli babbitt
1967,U both need to step aside for real talent
1968,"No one respect USA, u started it trump"
1969,Thank god I’m 10000 klm away
1970,"Two derelicts, seriously is that all 350m population has to offer. My god"
1971,id have Biden in any state over Trump
1972,"Did anyone ask Biden if he even wanted to be president?! Because I&#39;m feeling like he doesn&#39;t want to be and factually, shouldn&#39;t be. Let the old man rest. He seems tired. And I mean that with a warm heart. Look at the dude, he isn&#39;t doing well and can barely stand and speak. Idk who&#39;s idea it was to let him try n be our next president again ... But I&#39;m assuming those ppl who do, haven&#39;t seen Biden speak at all. How can he run an entire country?!? Insane to me. We were so much better off when trump was in office, the proof is in the numbers."
1973,Fjb
1974,The &quot;I don think he knows what he said either&quot; comment will go down w Reagan&#39;s age joke and Obama&#39;s line about bayonets as the best Presidential debate comments since the advent of televised debates
1975,Why is trump center all his points on border control alone.....here in Europe they have no physical border. <br>Make more concrete points everything shouldn&#39;t be about border alone. I think Biden should step aside for more energetic younger person to contest with Trump. <br><br>American is gradually playing politics like Africa.<br>Biden just mentioned something that struck me his son served in the military in Iraq can trump tell us what his children have done to serve America???<br><br>Not about taking tax payers alone and turn around to abuse them because you&#39;re in charge of the highest office. American people would decide who they want as their president.
1976,"Man, I’m freaking crying. We love you, President Donald Trump. God bless you, man Jesus Christ protect Donald Trump. Please protect him. We need President Donald Trump in the White House please we love President Donald Trump. He’s the best president we ever had. Amen."
1977,Biden is senile
1978,The United States is weak under biden!!
1979,"Yes he may have had a large national debt, BUT covid broke out during trumps administration!!! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#trump2024</a>"
1980,Trump is NOT the only one who thinks our country was GREAT again under his administration!!
1981,We have the most successful economy in the World😢 that&#39;s a lie!
1982,THE IDEA that biden claims trump is the worst president is pure comedy
1983,"Many people assume the Democratic Party champions civil rights, but history tells a different story. Since its inception in 1829, the Democratic Party has a troubling legacy of opposing major civil rights advancements. It defended slavery, instigated the Civil War, and resisted Reconstruction efforts. The party founded the Ku Klux Klan, enforced segregation, and obstructed civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s.<br><br>Conversely, the Republican Party emerged in 1854 as an anti-slavery movement. Its founding mission aimed to halt slavery&#39;s expansion and eventually abolish it. This stance faced setbacks, notably the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford case where Democratic-appointed justices ruled against citizenship for slaves. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, led the nation through the Civil War and emancipated the slaves.<br><br>Following Lincoln&#39;s assassination by a Democrat, Andrew Johnson—a Democrat—opposed Lincoln&#39;s plans for integrating freed slaves into society. Democrats continued to resist constitutional amendments abolishing slavery and granting citizenship and voting rights to blacks, amendments passed with overwhelming Republican support.<br><br>During Reconstruction, Republicans secured rights for freed slaves, electing numerous black representatives to Congress. However, Democratic resurgence after Reconstruction reintroduced racial oppression through laws like black codes, poll taxes, and literacy tests, enforced through terror tactics by groups like the Ku Klux Klan.<br><br>Even President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, supported segregation and promoted racist propaganda. Decades later, significant Democratic opposition stalled the Civil Rights Act of 1964, while Republicans overwhelmingly supported it, overcoming Democratic filibusters.<br><br>Despite historical injustices, Democrats shifted strategy, seeking black voter allegiance through government assistance programs. Yet, these policies have often perpetuated dependency and harmed black communities, weakening families, limiting educational opportunities, and undermining public safety.<br><br>In assessing the parties&#39; roles in advancing racial equality and civil rights, understanding this complex history is crucial. It challenges the narrative of Democratic leadership in civil rights, revealing a legacy marked by resistance and failed policies that have impacted black Americans profoundly.—Carol Swain"
1984,How many times did biden say THE IDEA
1985,I really wish he answered about the immigrant question
1986,CNN is a joke totally favored sleepy Joe.
1987,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2813"">46:53</a>😂😂"

2249,I urge all of you to stay strong especially after what happened today. You have to try harder than that to take out trump
2250,Biden looks more lost than “Lucy” in 50 first dates 😂
2251,"They trust us, Americans- not you, Joe Biden."
2252,Biden can’t even stay on topic complete 1 coherent sentence. My cheeks are literally flushed by secondhand embarrassment .
2253,What South Park character do you think is going to play Joe’s bit? I’m thinking Jimmy? Butters? Mr Poo? 💩
2254,I THINK BIDEN IS MORE LENIENT AND HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE HIS PRESIDENCY COZ HE HELP THE NEEDIES  COUNTRIES THAN TRUMP IS FULL OF VENGRANCE AND   HE IS A MONEY  FACE

2276,"It is better for Trump not to show himself in open spaces, since he is against the war, and since Biden knows no boundaries. Otherwise, Kennedy already somehow wanted to nationalize the US federal system, also went against powerful elites, and Kennedy was killed by a sniper shot. It is always necessary to look at who benefits, and not the official versions of the corrupt US special services like a madman shot"

2302,"A home is made of parents and children. The behavior of a child such as expressions, gestures, tone of voice and way of thinking is influenced by repeated experience that an individual would adapt if there is comfort. If there is hardship, the individual will learn to oppose the reason for hardship becuase an individual would not want others to feel the same way. It is a child&#39;s natural behavior to not share an experience that hurts because fear existed first than any other feeling. Before a baby cry, fear from spanking is the first. Before a child feels happines, fear of losing a child&#39;s parents goes first. Before an adult feels anger, he&#39;s been literate enough to see conflicts in a global level. Happiness, only child who grew up with their parents feels it. Do you remember getting lost not knowing where your parents went when all along they were holding you with their hands inside a mall? Isn&#39;t it total happiness to know they didn&#39;t lose you and you didn&#39;t get to be picked by a stranger."
2303,"I hope Amerikan people find president like Kennedy young, full power and energy. You need it today. I dont know Trump, but remember what happen in Capitol. Ugh."
2304,Id vote for trump but hes dodging too many questions
2305,Are these really live? It doesn&#39;t say it is live. It has a duration of 1 hour 38 minutes and eighteen seconds earlier too. I only feel it is life when I&#39;m high with meth. 😅 These guys wouldn&#39;t know me anyway. Who am I for them to know me. I even don&#39;t remember their gestures. It is not live. It&#39;s what the playscreen says. It was live before I saw it. I love meth it makes everything true for me. Ahehe . . . True true true true true!
2306,"I am from Finland, and have to say Biden isnt ok, is he ill , sometimes I think he is out what is wrong."
2307,"No, that $100 basket of groceries is now $320"
2308,Trump is clueless 😂😂😂😂
2309,"Thank you for your service Mr. President. Now it&#39;s time to leave the office with some modicum of dignity, and also giving your party some type of a chance in the election. 🙄"
2310,You could believe they r coming from parallele worlds where things are the opposite.
2311,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=851"">14:11</a> Biden has seen the other side"
2312,"Stupid garbage by both parties.  The idea that the US is a 3rd world country or that the US is uniformly disrespected is just as preposterous.  The US despite the junk from both parties and their stiffling burocracies continues to expand its enormously capable infrastructure and  its monetary value that makes deficits irrelevant. The most relevant issues relate to extent to which government  monopolizes scarce resources especially labor and hinders creativity by failing to reduce and consolidate outmoded unnecessary laws and regulations while failing to put far more emphasis on protecting us from domestic white collar  and financial system crime and  deeply rooted highly dangerous actual and latent  cyber-attacks by hostile countries esp Russia, NKorea and China."

2321,I cant believe we only have these two as our only choice. So depressing
2322,satu pro putin satu pro china?sedangkan rusia dan china bersahabat saat ini dlm (BRICKS)..kesimpulan disini demokrat dan rebublik yg bermasaalah(mereka)siapapun yg menang usa tetap usa?
2323,It’s amazing how Biden can deny about the border problem
2324,"I still don&#39;t understand how a country like the U.S, most of the time elect people too old to run a country like theirs. I mean there are great potential candidates young and energetic to run such a great country. The good thing is <br>Next election will have new candidates for Americans to choose from."
2325,"That&#39;s right blame it all on the immigrants - talk to any political scientist, Trump&#39;s just like any other populist : making America great, clean water and air to solve climate change, saying that Biden is just about a criminal - at least he wants to tax the rich and address the issues with actions not banter. I think America could do with smarter leaders, and Biden is getting on in years but he seems to know how grave the situation is, while Trump&#39;s all about charm"
2326,Notice the hand Signals to Biden from the Moderator.
2327,WATCH NATO SUMMIT.<br>I STAND FOR BIDEN
2328,And by the way...
2329,Biden really believes people like him!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 THEIR whole establishment STINKS!!!!!
2330,"First Trump takes credit for initiating the pull out from Afghanistan, then blames Biden for inciting war because oft he pullout. Biden isnt fit. Far from it. But it&#39;s scary to have the peach from James and the Giant Peach in the most powerful post in the World."
2331,"That is something,I love in American Drmocracy"
2332,And yet we are a superpower... go figure. To all the people that say this country is the greatest in the world I suggest opening your eyes a little wider.

2343,Trump I don’t know what  Biden said I so confuse. Too ! I’m very confused smh
2344,Trump I don’t know what  Biden said I so confuse. Too !
2345,REMEMBER THIS: THERE IS A low OCCULT campaign to start  and discredit a honest stuttering President by emotional AND NOT ON SUBSTANCE triggers.<br>Their plan as internal &amp; foreign plotters Won&#39;t Work against young and good hearted positive people...!
2346,Bother their response to drug addiction is equivalent to blame the gun not the person. 🤦‍♂️
2347,😟
2348,This was a bad night but Joe Biden is FAR more capable and I&#39;d MUCH rather have him in office than a convicted criminal!
2349,Looks like neither of them are a good fit for president of the US. Neither of them have a concrete idea of doing something better other than just blaming each other.  Waste of time.
2350,The Debate
2351,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1347"">22:27</a> - “Brandon, just speak to them” 💀💀💀"

2354,"I’m an Australian, I really shouldn’t be weighing in on this.. but I’m worried, real worried about what this election means for the world. Especially the allies of the U.S. I think we’re f****d either way. Pray for the world 🙏🏼"
2355,"Roe v Wade is the most important issue, and Biden is pro-women’s rights. Vote Biden!"
2356,Biden might vote for Trump after this debate 😂
2357,1000% Biden got all the questions pre hand
2358,"As an Aussie, THIS IS GOLD 😂 <br><br>Haha Trump V What ever that mumbling thing next to him is 😂😂😂"
2359,"Honestly all the inflation talk when Trump was president as a single mom I could afford to provide for me and my daughter, but now? I&#39;m thankful to have a partner to help me because when Biden came into office I lost my home my vehicle and many days my daughter was the only one to eat. My job didn&#39;t change I worked 16&#39;s multiple times a week to try and keep a roof over my families head."
2360,Most of the time Biden stood with his mouth slightly open; it was noticeable that he was trying to understand the essence of what was happening and these efforts were extremely difficult for him.  Only a blind person would not see that an old sick person needs to retire!
2361,"When history is written Trump will go down as the best president of this century and possibly the best president ever since General GEORGE.  AND T is right that the world hates Biden and loves Trump. And the more the propaganda empire villianozes Trump, the more everyone loves him because we all know how stupid everything targeted against Trump.   The only ones who thinks it’s legit in the CNN zombies.  NO one that thinks for themselves thinks anything but that Trump is a true patriot and might very well end up saving our country from being taken over by communist criminals.  Masked as Democratic Socialism.  Even president Reagan said if communists rears its ugly head and sneaks in it will be under the guise of democratic socialism and through the democrats and DNC.  Trump worked harder than nearly anyone before him.   Every time Biden starts with his turn he says.  Everything he said are lies, not true.   Blah blah.  Biden is a criminal that steals from taxpayers and he thinks he can say who a patriot is???   Definitely not him or his lackey friends."

2364,"NATO has become a transnational corporation (disadvantages of globalization) that is trying to dictate its will to the United States and Europe (supranational level), to recruit their presidents, perhaps promising them something or maybe covertly threatening them. After all, NATO is geographically located in Brussels (Europe), and not in the United States"
2365,"Biden was just lucky to win the election 2021, while the US people mistakenly thought that Trump was not coping with the coronavirus, the US people thought that Biden would do better in 2021 and did not even imagine what kind of mess they would get into with this Biden. Biden has worsened the country in all directions, inflation, the southern border, life has become expensive and unsafe, further more, Biden does not care about the people at all, when they tell him about it, he smiles and when asked what you say why people are unhappy, he answers: I do not blame them for being unhappy. How high is Biden&#39;s ego, a lot of narcissism"
2366,"why is Biden trying to brainwash everyone, allegedly Russia is trying to restore the USSR. This is nonsense. The reason for Russia&#39;s actions is that the United States sponsored a coup in Ukraine in 2014. and then they began to exterminate the civilian population of Donbass, to bring NATO troops into Ukraine, pulling them up to the borders of Russia, and this after Russia left the GDR in 1994 (It was Russia that ruled a country like the USSR), believing NATO&#39;s promises. and Biden&#39;s son participated in bio-weapon laboratories created by the United States and Ukraine on the territory of Ukraine. Russia is just ensuring its security. At one time, the United States helped destroy the USSR and, among other things, split Ukraine from Russia. Russia does not interfere with Europe in any way, Ukraine is not a member of the European Union, but Europe is very concerned about Russophobic sentiments, because of economic envy, to the point that Europe has the audacity to supply weapons to Ukraine. It is clear to everyone what kind of organization NATO is and by whom it is run. if Russia wanted to, there would have been no Europe for a long time, but Russia does not do this, because it understands that it is necessary to ensure peace and prevent a big war, only to protect its borders and Russian people, and to stop the lawless power in Ukraine that came through a coup in 2014"
2367,"Biden is trying to explain with open flattery and words the United States is a great country that his presidency is very good, that is, in fact, he is not praising the country but praising himself"
2368,Bidden need stay at home and play with his kid. He is too young to be president 😂
2369,"alright, watching biden saying &quot;weprofudodp prusic forece aah&quot; is a bit weird<br><br>greetings from Russia"
2370,"Biden talks such nonsense about taxes, and always says number 1, number 2, as if some psychologist taught him that he should always bring at least 2 counterarguments, even if they are sucked out of his finger and complete nonsense."
2371,"I heard Biden say that he had cut spending on black children. how he can say such a thing on a public TV... Well, as for drugs, what Trump says under Biden has increased, of course, and Biden apparently takes them, and Zelensky and for the the Armed Forces of Ukraine are needed, because they come from somewhere, it&#39;s clear from where. So it&#39;s clear that Biden is to blame for this."
2372,Joe Biden worst president in USA history is what he’ll be known for.
2373,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=712"">11:52</a> bruh there&#39;s no absolute way"
2374,Sad!
2375,He just had a cold and a bad night.
2376,Trump is so bad mouthed 😂😂😂 <br>The indirect shade 😂<br>They sound like old married couple in counseling or going through divorce 😂
2377,When Biden speaks I&#39;m just reminded of 3rd grade school plays where I just said my lines so I can go back home &amp; drink my strawberry milk. No passion behind it. Just saying what they wanted me to get out. No pushing to get more words out. No emotion. It just feels like these questions were rehearsed for Biden to respond to. They cut him off before he can get any more incoherent or redundant in his ramblings. I really hope even if trump loses they just let him out &amp; enjoy his last days in his own world. I really feel bad for the guy. Theyre squeezing all they can out of him like rolling toothpaste.
2378,BIden :-😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦

2392,That was embarrassing.
2393,Did Trump answer any questions....Billions of Billions of unanswered questions. Imagine a debate where there was zero finger pointing and questions were actually answered.
2394,These guys😂😂
2395,I’m so disappointed. God help us.
2396,"I think a cognitive skills test should be done on any candidate before taking charge, I&#39;m literally zoning out on the stupidity and lack of logic and reasoning, sir please step aside and calm down"
2397,Its kinda frustrating that a lot of the questions they are asking are not being answered by either person...
2398,Rip the baby out on the 9th mouth? Is he talking about premature births? Woman are pregnant typically for 37 to 42 weeks 8.5 to 9.6 mouths

2411,Biden also looks as this is the first time he’s ever heard this every time trump says facts.  And looks upset that the moderators aren’t backing him up
2412,I think it is the policy and his track record of getting things done and whether he kept his word after he was elected and how long term his vision is and what methodology he used to build the path towards that and whether his vision for global balance and peace was intricately and fairly constructed — is what you should be arguing about instead of his humane mistakes that anyone can make. No one is perfect. Come on America. I thought your hearts were as big as your thighs and waists and Big Mac jumbo sets! You being so small right now on Biden!

2429,Biden&#39;s reactions are killing me 😂
2430,"IF you criticize Biden, your comments get blocked. Imagine that! FOAD Biden."
2431,"I&#39;d vote for Biden in coma than voting for Trump. Besides, if he dies, Kamala Harris would still do a better job than Trump. I used to think that George W. Bush was the worse president ever in modern era, but Trump surpassed him in light years. It&#39;s a nightmare that he could be president again..."

2446,Alley cat....who cares. Just like with Clinton...who cares.
2447,All these amazing stories from Biden but yet we are paying triple to live like we did three years ago.
2448,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=84"">1:24</a> Biden attacks Trump about holding his own bag playing golf. Really? I just saw a short where Trump prevented Melanie from falling when she tripped. Biden can barely support his own skeletal system and can barely talk let alone catch a woman when she falls or carry his own golf clubs. He calls Trump a whiner but he attack Trump in an area that the whole entire nation knows is a weak jab because we have all witnessed him stumble. He should feel ashamed for saying something so stupid, childish, and obviously that of a desperate man because his opponent is far stronger physically and politically. That was weak and pathetic and the attack of a scared and whiney man. Trump was strong, passionate, civil, and dignified."
2449,"Svako zna da ce opet namestiti da biden pobedi, kao sto su i 2020 godine namestili za bidena"
2450,"I like the part where Biden coughed and slowly raised his hand to cover his mouth, way too late, then left his hand there for a good 5 seconds."
2451,"Candidates for elections in the USA are a logical consequence of the life and development of society. On the one hand, a megalomaniac and maniac, a liar and an arrogant braggart with a mission to dominate the world stage. His opponent depicts a part of society cut off from reality, the consequences and the tragedy that his policy is causing around the world. Both puppets of excessive ego who, from a position of power and calculation throughout history, deceive themselves and everyone around them. Both victims of a system that cannot change, creating the illusion of rivalry, complement each other."
2452,And they still want Trump to give up running for President even when Biden can&#39;t get his words straight

Dangerous precedent democrats want to set, blatantly making up evidence to prosecute political opponents.<br><br>I try to be an honest person I know this already happens but at least they take the time to cover it up and not do it in public in front of everyone and then have half the population ADVOCATING for there to be no prosecution. This is literally disgusting and be honest with yourself doesn&#39;t it sound like I&#39;m talking about a third world country? <br><br>Sadly no we are literally the worlds police as of this moment, and you really think the world is going to let us continue in that role as we have political witch hunts like this? I&#39;m fairly certain we are going to get into a few more wars coming up and we won&#39;t be the good guys and it&#39;s because of our habit of causing coups in places like Ukraine and Libya but never talking about that part then blast the WORLD with propaganda about the events that came AFTER the coup."

2572,"Trump talked the same way the first time around but the media did such a good job making it look like ignorance most believed it. now when the media says Trump is talking crazy, we are saying is he really?"
2573,"Is this the LAST RECENT DEBATE because if you TYPE that question IN YOU GET NO RESPONSE=== very slick of the NEWS MEDIA or YOU TUBE??????? Anyhow I,LL TURN THIS OFF and go right to BARNABY JONES because CANDIDATE GUY #1 says &quot;&quot;&quot;UNDER MY REGIME WE HAD THE BEST 25 FLAVOURINGS FOR COFFEE!!!&quot;&quot;&quot; then CANDIDATE #2 GUY says &quot;&quot;&quot; UNDER MY REGIME WE WARNED AMERICAN CITIZENS OF COFFEE FLAVOURINGS!!!!&quot;&quot;&quot; So I,LL stay home on ELECTION DAY and SWITCH TO TEA*<b>****</b>"
2574,Trump wins the election by one vote. He tries to find out who the last vote was. It was Biden. He then says to Biden &quot;after all this you still voted for me?&quot; Trump then changes his vote to Biden which then makes it a tie. They both get very emotional. Biden then leans in and makes out with trump on national television.They run away and live the rest of their lives together. Which leaves Kanye west as the 47th president of the United States.
2575,I will take a person that Stutters over a dishonest Multibillionaire.
2576,"Отпустите уже Байдена на покой! Ему тяжело. Он уже заслужил теплый плед, мягкие тапочки и симпатичную сиделку."

The disparages of our system can seem unbearable and starting from the bottom, all the way to the top, one step at a time, is how we&#39;ll enact a more equitable society. <br>But, I&#39;m still too young (VP only!)<br><br>We need to come together as the United States of America;<br>namely,<br>We all must work; if we&#39;ve need supplement of our Govt., as Nationals, we must Volunteer at the least, strictly in maintaining our Society. Every one of us United States of America Nationals deserve Housing, a Job, and Financial Aid;<br>maintaining one designated building in the heart of every downtown, in every City, to supply these needs will promote so much growth in such a rough market that we do currently face.<br><br>Building upon our Democratic leadership that I follow in direct cadence, we must:<br>• focus on Police Reform, Criminal Reform, and in fixing our Mental Health System;<br>• building upon from the bottom to the top, the middle out, focusing on creating jobs in all sectors in Semiconductors, Food Processing, Manufacturing; and absolutely<br>• focusing on bad banking practices and in fixing these issues, in predatory lending, triple loans, reliance on Corporations too big to fail; <br>then there&#39;s even<br>• Housing Reform:<br>(1) Deed, per citizen, and or persons with dependents; negotiable, not mandatory; implementations:(1) House, (1) Apartment Complex, (1) Lease, (1) Corporation, (1) Entity, (1) building High-rise; simple! It&#39;s clear to see that the Real Estate market is leading our Economy and Society without a single thread of oversight, and it&#39;s with shortsighted policies like these that skew, misrepresent, and shatter the current divide of our current American society;<br>• Immigration Reform:<br>Process and Deportation with a negotiable Warning or added Criminal charges if the subject is already within the system and these undocumented crossings are continuous;<br>• Refugee Asylum Reform:<br>Strict Background Check and applicating process, Case Management oversight with weekly (1)+ hour appointments, mandatory job seeking (3)+ per appointment, Governmental subsidies never be granted ~(10)+ years, supplemental housing never be granted ~(10)+ years;<br>• Filibuster Reform:<br>Perfect Proposals, instrumental Acts, life-changing Bills, imperative Amendments that are yielded on the floor, with a system in place of voted-upon of Yeays or Nays, unless getting at least the simple majority in the House (218/435), and concurrently the simple majority in the Senate (51/100), they&#39;re dead on arrival, and the only pressure we have is filibustering. Eliminating motions that bring bills to the Senate floor, eliminating filibustering Amendments, and eliminating the no-effort filibuster, would give every Senator a voice but not a veto;<br>• Homelessness Initiatives:<br>1...Public Loos, in every City!<br>2...Public electrical outlets, in every City!<br>3...Public LaborReady locales to work for (at least) $20.00/day, in every City!<br>as these basic necessities are not only overlooked, but unprovided as it stands; Whereas, public defication is Illegal; Whereas, loitering is illegal; Whereas, businesses bar our public from even using their services without exchange(s) of monies; Whereas, finding (3) pennies is all that&#39;s promised from walking any citystreets for (24)-hours;<br>• Corporate Credited Reform:<br>Many Corporations have enabled Refinancing, Loans, credit APRs that at least double mandated-payments with massive interest hikes, risky Mortgages that necessitate paycheck-to-paycheck (20)-year payments, and these practices benefit mostly these Entities, while leaving so many of our fellow Americans in close to impossible arrears;<br>• Judicial Reform:<br>When so many massive discrepancies, credible, unjust lawsuits getting completely swept under the rug with dismissals, incredulous taking sides and one-sided judgements, we need an Infrastructure system in place to have oversight over these types of scenarios; a much more involved Supreme Court;<br>• Financial Regulatory Reform:<br>Bad banking practices affect our entire Nation on nearly all levels, from the bottom to the top, with a select few able to regulate. And, it is all-encompassing. Measures to assist our fellow citizens with a Risk Assessor, Payment Deliberator, and or an Accountant,  who work for their clientele in reversing foreclosures, stopping bankruptcies, defusing exclusions, and in having a Judge to strictly mitigate Banking cases, will ease these monumental deficits;<br>and<br>so very much more!<br><br>All our best!<br>🇺🇸 Team Mercury 🇺🇲<br>💌Ry Kraft for President!"

2646,May be a Boxing match before the election. 😅
2647,Biden is lying things have never been so High and this is very difficult for people on fixed income and very hard for the people of this country cannot buy a house or rent an apartment this is ridiculous raising taxes and the interest rate and it is going to crash the economy and put us in a Depression
2648,This is the person with the nuclear code? I&#39;m scared.
2649,COMEDY GOLD 😆😆😆
2650,Look at him Biden is not all the way there
2651,Trump is going to win this election
2652,Standing on own foot for so long ! Commendable job Mr. President
2653,"I agree on the surface tax cuts for corporations etc seem unfair but those companies then are able to put more jobs in America versus overseas where they avoid the taxes ,thus providing more jobs for Americans"
2654,$100 groceries now $120!!that’s a joke it’s at least double!!
2655,Bidens defense: he is lying!
2656,"Trump is ready to rumble, Biden is ready to mumble"
2657,Biden is washed up
2658,"Hey, can anyone confirm, is it game over? Who actually lost?"
2659,"The whole world is blowing up behind biden presidency 💆🏾‍♂️💆🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1812"">30:12</a>"
2660,Trump rocked <br>And biden shocked😂😂😂
2661,what the sigma 💀
2662,😂💀
2663,Trump 2024🎉
2664,They both need to drop out get a regular citizen to go to the polls so much corruption in the government
2665,They did not go by the rules moderaters sucked
2666,You did it Joe.
2667,2020 election was stolen
2668,Why a country so great like America has only these two very old men to lead them? I really wonder 🤔
2669,It&#39;s like Kendrick Vs Drake😂
2670,Everytime biden was saying « the idea » he was like : 😬 it felt like he was bout to say « the iKea »
2671,"Joe, you gotta go."
2672,Who else feels unbearable pity for Joe? The fact that those closest to him are using and encouraging him is disgusting. Jill should be ashamed.
2673,Watching from France i really enjoyed that South Park episode.
2674,"Out of all the great human beings in the US, you guys have a pick of these two bongos bravo 👏🏽"
2675,"I know I don&#39;t get to follow politics as much as I should, and honestly I&#39;m not sure it matters who is at the head if the Congress, Senate and House are actually working for the good of all people. <br><br>That said, this was a disgrace. When will candidates act like gentlemen again and not children. To say they laid out any good information would be an extreme overstatement. <br><br>Neither one answered the child care costs. Wouldn&#39;t matter anyway. If there&#39;s a cost hike, everything and everyone needs a hike to even it out. At some point the number is irrelevant. The McDonald&#39;s employees will be paid$1000/hr and gas will be $300/gal."
2676,"So is this the US Presidential Debate in 2024?<br>With the Republician Representative Donald Trump yapping over there on the left and Democratic Party Representative Joe Biden putting  an 😦 face on the right.<br>Out of all the 90 minutes of the debate, there&#39;s barely any question that was answered, they were just having a chit-chat of arguing that the opponent&#39;s the worst presidents. When they&#39;re being ask about whether they&#39;re capable of being elected as the President of the United States for the next 4 years, what the debaters being arguing is about golf... Is this even revelent to the question? <br>Literally, no solution that was given to solve these problems, espically for whether womens have the right to abortion. Joe Biden over there were just talking about a case that happened when there was a women that was rapped by illegal immigrants, whereas Donald Trump over there were blaming Joe Biden for letting the illegal immigrants into the border (and that&#39;s basically what Trump being saying throughout the debate). I wonder if Joe Biden has been drinking alcohol before the debate, because he&#39;s seriously drunk by mentioning about &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; rapping an women when he&#39;s the person who&#39;s responsible for opening up the border at Texas. <br><br>The scary thing about this debate is not that what they&#39;re debating, it&#39;s how there&#39;s only two people to vote."
2677,its wrong to abuse grandpar in the nursing home.
2678,"It’s crazy that a man with dementia sounds more logical than Trump. Trump is reactive and defensive. He is just defending himself with lies and deflection. I like Trump and I think he has some valid point about the economy, but he really comes off as a guy without a real plan. This is terrible for America. Trump is right. America is turning into a third world country, where crooks with money is the only candidate option to run the country. One is worse than the other 🤦‍♂️"
2679,That picture of Biden is from like 2012 🤣🤣🤣
2680,"😂😂😂 These comments, I&#39;m dead!!!"
2681,"Very true! Trump was the worst President the USA ever had since the start of this beautiful Country AMERICA history. Trump should not be allowed to go back to the white house. Please, please do not let him be back coz he is a person who thinks of himself only."
2682,"Mr trump how can you think to stop Social Security, how do you think we old Americans will live on. Remember we earned our Social Security pention with our hard works n contributed for that."
2683,"What trump did of calling Biden a criminal is very bad thing to say n very disrespectful to say to a President, also we can say that is assignation of character. I would not vote  him even if he were the only candidate."
2684,My joy is only reading coments😂😂
2685,The &quot;evolution&quot; of Donald J. Trump is night and day in coherent speeches.
2686,May TRUMP WIN!
2687,Trump FTW
2688,TRUMP 2024!!🇺🇲
2689,"THE IDEA THAT........BLAH BLAH BLAH, #1....BLAH BLAH BLAH#2.....BLAH BLAH BLAH, Oh and by the way....!  YOU ARE A #2 JOE! You sound like a broken record! Answer the questions instead of diverting into another subject as though no one notices"
2690,"Its laughable how &quot;politics&quot; in USA goes now. No matter who will take cabinet. War is inevitable, since they in same system. Trump only using current situation around Israel &amp; Ukraine as an excuses, but he did nothing to prevent escalation in Ukraine when he was in charge. And that was the point when situation there was not good and already over thousand dead."

2693,"Joe is going through dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. When are they going to make it public ?? Stop hiding these things from the people!!! It’s okay.. it’s human … he’s older. It’s okay to let go Joe… but, to continue to try and stay in this fight is letting us Americans down because you cannot FULLY commit to the presidential term…."

2698,Oh yeah what about all of our equipment that Trump had build up and you left it for the enemy what about that Biden?
2699,What do you expect with a fraudulent president puppet for China
2700,Yes they are and they&#39;re draining our system thanks a lot Biden
2701,Were these two clowns seriously arguing about who is the better golfer?
2702,Hey Biden what about your illegal underground government where you are standing by letting these covens rip off the American people? What about that and you&#39;re stolen election?
2703,Oh you mean Obama&#39;s cages Good for you
2704,Try not to laugh part 97 | 2024 presidential debate

2715,crazy they still have this up
2716,"Having listened to this debate up to the Israel- Hamas issue, I  conclude Biden is not Obama, but he isn&#39;t a write off as many claim. He&#39;s a better deal for the Americans than Trump. He could be having old age issues, but he the better of two evils unless the Democrats  can pick a replacement now."
2717,Shameless Biden talking biggest supporter of war criminals and Nazis.
2718,Any Biden supporters in these comments?????? Didn’t think so 😏
2719,Trump: Brags about country in very marketable way per training as a capitalist. <br>Biden: Lies every chance he gets and spouts false information regularly. <br>Yeah I am not voting
2720,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2516"">41:56</a> On the right stands a man who has been in politics his whole life, and has campaigned on the same issues his whole career, but, just can&#39;t get it right.

2731,One zionist auditioning for the leading role in walking dead and the other criminal auditioning for the role of Al capone
2732,How many times does Biden say “Oh and by the way”….
2733,Who would have guessed that this would end up being one of the most consequential debates in American history?<br><br>Edit: And Biden drops out-oh boy
2734,I have listened for a couple of  minutes. Both Biden and Trump need step down. We need younger leaders.
2735,"Look at Bidens face, mouth gaping open, blank stare, incoherent sentences and the list goes on. Biden’s the President? What a sham."
2736,Awas pd2 in jerman digu.

2739,Is it amust for some one to stand during debates? Biden seems weak he might even colapse
2740,Trump being braindead metaphorically. Biden being braindead LITERALLY<br><br>Hilarious
2741,I can&#39;t believe this is the best we have to offer.  Makes me want to run for President!!
2742,"All Trump had to do was speak honestly and he&#39;d have won the debate.  Instead, all Trump did was prove why George Santos is STILL the perfect poster-child for today&#39;s Republican party."
2743,"Biden was sharp, and didn’t fail, except for one time in a lengthy portion. His voice was weak, but millions of people have weak voices, and don’t get promotions to higher paying jobs because of that, so the problem is the capitalist wage system that causes world poverty because they expect and need some unemployed workers…who then can’t buy food or medical care for their children. <br><br>Danny Thomas started St. Jude Children’s Hospital to help children who get cancer and their families get treatment because millions couldn’t afford any medical care. His vision evolved from wanting to build a general hospital in the early 1950’s, to becoming a Children’s cancer research hospital, which opened in 1962 and is still funded by generous donors. At that time children had a 20% survival rate, and now has a 94% survival rate for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, using therapy that does not include radiation in 2006."
2744,me as neutral non american need to say: biden is the biggest clown in the history of the us. i remember a time where usa was the best countrry everyone wasd looking up to but now its just a shadow of its own.
2745,"🍿 I can’t talk right now , I’m watching the season finale of the United States"
2746,"As a Veteran, Biden has done nothing but make things worse for me. FJB."
2747,MAGA🎉❤❤❤❤

2750,This is just akward at this point
2751,I am Canadian but This video shows how Biden is well educated man. I can not get a sense of Trump responses. Biden seems to be baby sitting Donald.

2758,The fact Biden did actually label black people super predators is beyond wild in the act to change law and conviction towards black people
2759,"Trump win for USA win for Italia, save the world!"
2760,"As far as drug addiction, I think at some point we need to stop coddling the addict.  There are programs if the addict is serious about getting help.  For the president to be responsible for these addicts&#39; actions is ridiculous.."
2761,The real president isn’t born yet.
2762,Yup hypocrites
2763,I don&#39;t know who is telling Biden that he is doing all this good stuff.  I don&#39;t see any of it.  I still live paycheck to paycheck and can&#39;t afford health care.  I won&#39;t be able to afford Medicare when I retire either.
2764,I don’t think biden did bad - all Trump did was lying
2765,Black Mirror&#39;s best episode yet.

2773,😢
2774,Biden lost the walk to the podium and lost America every second after
2775,And the big winner is not the big guy
2776,Why can&#39;t trump answer a question without bashing Biden?
2777,I never knew that elders fights are that bad😂
2778,When the woman sitting said thank you so loud when biden was talking and he was like:🤦🤦
2779,I don&#39;t think biden can talk anymore 😊
2780,"Why does it look like Biden is referring to answers on his tablets of paper? I thought the media was not to provide these questions to the candidates prior to the debate, but at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2038"">33:58</a> there&#39;s old Joe, turning pages like he&#39;s moving ahead with the next answers he&#39;s been provided. Who is running the United States of America? Why is the MSM covering for these traitors?"
2781,They are both old   i bet my grandpa will be a better president 😂
2782,The idea and by the way 2 lines this FJB used
2783,"Stop calling him President Trump, He is CONVICTED Trump."
2784,pra quem entende o que esta sendo dito pode perceber que como sempre ambos falam a pura verdade
2785,"President Trump, Pass on deciding on picking sides. THIS ELECTIONS IS FOR HELPING THE WHOLE AMERICA, NO WAR, NO ASSASSINATION NOTRICKS. REBUILDING INTO THE FUTURE. YOU, ADMIT AMERICA&#39;S MISTAKE AND WRONGS SO THAT YOU ALL CAN BUILD UP NO BRIDGES WITH AFRICA, SOUTH AMERICAS, THE MIDDLE EASTS, RUSSIA AND CHINA.

2786,Presidential debate😊
2787,Why are their ties so horribly done?
2788,What a rout this was. Trump mopped the floor with this dementia patient.
2789,"Im <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=404"">6:44</a> in and my first thought is that this seems phyiscally challenging for biden to even talk at this pace. Will he survive 90 minutes?"
2790,Trump it’s the right president the right men to be on power in USA
2791,The “idea” that Biden truly believes he’s making sense and is mentally and physically fit to be president is flabbergasting.
2792,When he said groceries that costed 100 dollars are now 120 he must be talking  dollar tree 😂.
2793,The comment section just made my day 😂. May God help America
2794,Frankly speaking.<br><br>I&#39;m here to see the comment section.
2795,He serious too😂 price of gas?😂😂😂 that he caused?

2798,Wow...I finally got the guts to watch this. I&#39;m so sad now. Its a pity they can&#39;t realise that they are the same person...
2799,Wondering if Biden even knows where he is? he looks lost just the way he&#39;s looking in empty air instead of looking at Trump. Man i just lost in empty air
2800,Biden is dying man.
2801,I searched “Biden debate” and this video was buried under a 100 others.
2802,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1281"">21:21</a> <br>This is what i heard 🤔👂 <br><br>&quot;And imma gonna c-continue to move until we get to a total ban on t-t-t-the-the-the total initiative relative to what we&#39;re gonna do with more border patrol and more u-ugh side mufflers&quot;"

2826,I know yall did not just lowball inflation....seems like cnn is out of touch with what&#39;s really happening...
2827,Biden saying &quot;period!&quot; 💅 got me laughing so hard😂
2828,"If Biden wins, US is doomed."
2829,Let’s go Brandon
2830,I felt sorry for Biden too. Whoever is running that country shouldn’t have put him out there.
2831,"As Donald Trump says the war between Russia and Ukraine should never have been started, end of story. Donald Trump best president of USA ever"
2832,Oh is Biden talking about that chip deal that pelosi set up because she had insider trading on it?
2833,"At this point, the best solution might be to change the rules and let Obama have a third term! Biden and Trump have turned politics into a circus—let&#39;s bring back the ringmaster! 🎪🇺🇸"
2834,Good luck world.
2835,IDK how democrats believe all the lies Biden told and the moderators need to add a fact checker to these debates to keep the candidates honest unforutbately we have alot of guillible people watching this.
2836,So are we talking about politics or golf?

2844,I&#39;m going to start wearing a really long power tie.
2845,Trumps best move was not roasting joe and just letting him bury himself
2846,&quot;I call it Biden Migrant Crime&quot;
2847,Trump❤❤❤
2848,"I’m a Canadian, so this is hilarious but also incredibly scary and sad. I could watch squirrels talk better than this."
2849,I got a huge bump in pay THE DAY trump took office(ARMY). Idk what joes talking about
2850,"The blank stare , there once was a lot but these days there’s between those ears. I honestly start to feel bad but then I remember this is voluntary , he needs to just retire and enjoy his “golden years”"
2851,Ofc the number of illegal border crossings dropped . . . YOU MADE IT LEGAL. I’m an independent but Biden makes the choice so easy
2852,"Look at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2770"">46:10</a>. Biden couldn’t even express himself that he wanted to rebuddle trumps response and they gave Biden the time without him even asking<br><br>When it’s trump asking he has to fight for the time"
2853,The beginning started with lies.
2854,"After this video, I decided to vote in favor of Trump bro"
2855,"My opinion: Let’s be real here, Even not Obama, I would vote Mr Romney over Mr Trump and Joe. Look what we have today, just two guys talking about whose golf is better and beating Medicare. In 2012 election, at least they are answering different questions fluently with reverent points, and not hesitating and muttering before every single sentence like Biden did, it’s sad and worrying to see that Michelle Obama is not going to run for president. because under modern Democracy rules, If Joe Biden doesn’t want to quit, we will be left with Trump and Biden 🗿, <br><br><br><br>but let’s be real here, Trump is WAY better than Joe in terms of points and topics, though he lied what appears to be over 30 times, he is still the crowd favourite and better that the other one (Biden). Whether you like him or not, he is still one of the most successful and smart businessman and never make America look weak, he is the obvious choice here.<br><br>P.S. Back to 2012 to see what a REAL presidential debate needs to have."

2858,Wes ina ☻️✅️
2859,Biden be dyin…
2860,first comment
2861,あしたのジョー
2862,He looks like an 80 year old man who has worked for his last 60 years. My grandfather had dimensia. And Joe certainly doesn&#39;t look like he has alzheimers.  He&#39;s put a great cabinet together. A president shouldn&#39;t be doing the majority of the work. Plus Joe has Obama to help him run the country. Obama pulled the US out of a recession. Joe Biden helped the US avoid a recession.  All Trump did was lie this whole debate. The US is way more respected then when Trump was the president. Trump put tariffs on China and they went elsewhere to purchase their products putting farmers into bankruptcy. Trump is desperate to become president. He doesn&#39;t want to face the facts of more court cases.
2863,"Это действительно забавно, похоже на шоу. Ну мы в России болеем за Байдена😅 об этом официально заявил Путин когда его спросили"
2864,I feel its like watching the devil taunting jesus with lies when he was on the cross. Yes biden is in a bad place but at least he isn&#39;t a downright liar etc !
2865,Finally the Big Lie that Biden was cognitively fit to be President is  exposed for all to see.
2866,Biden：😮😮😲😲
2867,But to say most of what was and always been to say that we arent the best economy even in are current situation i found to be very wrong so where then what does biden think is the nation with the greatest economy if he didnt think were not it
2868,Corperate green he called the problem hum missed that
2869,biden has a cheat sheet! u can see it if you pay close attention!
2870,Trump only knows how to lie
2871,Biden is so lost and Trump being Trump. Either way the world loses.
2872,I actually want Obama back bro 🙁
2873,This was a low intelectual debate.
2874,"It is is simply astonishing how corrupt political leaders who litteraly destroyed their own country in a few years such as Biden or Macron in France have the nerves to pretend they saved it, even when evidence are utterly against them. Just shows how low western countries have sunk with no bottom in sight. Hope Trump prevails in November."
2875,Biden is a liar . Not one bit of truth came out of his mouth. FJB
2876,… да…
2877,did anyone else catch trump calling Biden Brandon at 22;27 😂
2878,"Youtube flat out protects Biden and censors just about ANY TRUTHFUL non vulgar comments directed at his administration. Its a joke. A horrific one. And people want to say Trump is akin to Hitler. 😱😱🤣🤣. People need to start being held accountable for this from top to bottom and be removed from any position they might have and in many cases, brought up on criminal charges. All the lies and supression that are allowing this country to be intentionally self sabotaged are completely what an &quot;attack on democracy&quot; looks like."
2879,It&#39;s like watching the Golden Girls 😂
2880,"JOE BIDEN HAS DONE A HORRIBLE JOB, TRUMP DID BETTER WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT. THEY BOTH HAVE SERVED 4 YEARS AS PRESIDENT, SO WE&#39;VE LIVED THRU BOTH THEIR PRESIDENCY&#39;S. WAS AMERICA BETTER DURING TRUMP, OR DURING BIDEN? THE EVIDENCE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF..."
2881,Biden said 1000 trillionaries? God help you americans.
2882,we’re cooked.
2883,age limit for the love of god age limit
2884,"I&#39;m not a fan of Trump at all, but Trump absolutely owned Biden in this interview. Biden is senile, confused and totally demented."
2885,For the Love of God &amp; Country Vote Tulsi Gabbard!  VP! 👩🤳

2897,VOTE TRUMP GUYS!! DEMORATS DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!
2898,I guess voting Kanye West to be President is not that bad afterall
2899,All you do is lie Joe.
2900,The whole time Biden looked like he was trying to remember if he left the oven on or not
2901,Debate between the President and the main opposition leader on the same television program.<br><br>It is sad that this is not something that can happen in Turkey.
2902,Biden is a joke
2903,"While you have been sleeping, Joe, our nation has gone to the pits! Do yourself a favor and listen to someone who knows how to run our country!! Donald Trump!!!"
2904,As a Indian i will say its look like a roasting show😅
2905,Its like a train wreck...you cant look away.
2906,&quot;he went to the funeral&#39;..how dare he show some respect!
2907,Literally Joe is passing away as we speak
2908,😂
2909,Oh Joe shut up and go back to sleep
2910,300 million and this is the best we can do omg
2911,Thanks from Egypt 🇪🇬 ❤ I love USA 🇺🇸
2912,Joe I was in the navy we have the worst broken down ships ever worst military I ever seen . Wake up from your nap joe joe
2913,"Sadly Biden is old, being old is better than being selfish and scammer. I don&#39;t trust Trump, he can negotiate with Putin for personal gains"
2914,trump sounds like a total narcissist among all the other things…I don’t know how we have let go of all standards when it comes to presidential candidates. I don’t even know how this “debate” is real. just a bunch of pointing fingers
2915,"I don’t know how anyone could vote for Biden, I don’t even understand how he’s our President"
2916,Resident  yes  &quot;Resident&quot; Biden says &quot;the Government should decide on a woman&#39;s health&quot;   yet he mandates a Vagseen<br>Hypocrisy much?
2917,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=716"">11:56</a> covid skibidi uhhh"

2919,🤦🏾‍♀️😩🫣
2920,🇺🇸 God bless America! 🇺🇸<br>..not you Joe..
2921,"If you look at Biden and Teump, and really think, and compare the two on their policies, Biden wins every single time. Hands down. The only thing you can say is that one has a speech impediment. That&#39;s it."
2922,I know who I&#39;m voting for and falling up stairs hast been done my my choice lol
2923,TRUMP 2024 for Life!
2924,"Biden is a a real nightmare for USA SOCIETY,"
2925,puppet show
2926,Tremp ❤
2927,I don’t get why people are surprised at Biden’s performance. I genuinely couldn’t tell a difference between this debate performance and all the other times I’ve seen him speak.
2928,How does anyone not see these repeating patterns? <br>Biden opens the border then blames everyone for not passing a border bill<br><br>Biden gives Iran 6 billion dollars then Hamas attacks Israel and hezbollah has a 2.5 billion dollar military <br><br>Biden is weak on Putin with zero diplomacy then Putin attacks Ukraine<br><br>This idiot creates all these problems then tries to either take credit for trying to fix it or passes blame
2929,Something wrong with your analysis
2930,"Biden is too old and not excuses, he’s been done nothing worthwhile since he’s been all his life."
2931,I’m voting for Trump and without excuses nor exemptions
2932,"I grew up in a time where you were not supposed to say anything negative about the president, but I have to say that our current president has screwed up on just about everything! And, you aren&#39;t fooling anyone by opening our borders to get the only votes you will probably get. Please pass the office to one of the best presidents we&#39;ve ever had, Donald Trump!!!!!"
2933,"1hr and 40min straight of disparaging the other party and making outrageously false statements, on both sides. is this seriously the two people it comes down to? give me a f8cking break"
2934,Am going with trump 🎉🎉
2935,Ask him what a computer chip does
2936,He’s way to old
2937,Trust the dog first
2938,Biden you lost touch with Americans when companies move out of America. When you forced them too
2939,"As a middle class citizen, I was far financially better off under the Trump Administration than this current joke of an Administration.. 🤷"
2940,This is truly sad
2941,Joes worst appearance yet.
2942,Can’t believe he is our president!!!!!! Does anyone see this!!!!
2943,Does public housing included with this?????????
2944,"Why media has to host this presidential debates. CNN where do you get your numbers for the reality of inflation. From 100 to 120 bucks basket of groceries. The only way this can be truth is a basket of maruchan noodles packets. No milk, no bread, and no eggs.😢"
2945,Biden is taking his nap
2946,Trump really didn’t have to say anything. Just let Biden talk and he wins.
2947,"Good job, WSJ, you edited out all of Biden&#39;s senior moments! Cheaters!"
2948,Gee we can see who YouTube wants in the White House.<br>EVERYTIME TRUMP STARTS TO SPEAK YOUtube goes to s commercial (ad).Not once did YouTube go to commercial while BUMBLER BIDUM spoke.🤔🤔🤔
2949,Biden just pooped himself
2950,Where are the rest of the Americans now?
2951,Biden your debunked
2952,Wow should be none
2953,You killed it trump!!!!

2957,Why is joe  reading from cards ?
2958,Biden is like a sloth and Trump does nothing but tell humongous LIES.
2959,Biden is big liar
2960,"No one over 70 allowed to run... they have a minimum age, they definitely need a maximum age."
2961,"I think Trump has proven himself to be shamelessly narcissistic, which is never a good trait for a president. But watching this country vote Biden into office and then be so okay with his clear dementia and mental state, makes me think this country is a joke. Most of my close circle are openly democratic and push everyone to vote that way, but for Christ sake it&#39;s as if we are seeing two different things when talking about biden. Nobody in their right mind would want this man as their country&#39;s puppet as the administration does what they want in the background."
2962,Biden is logical and does not praise himself much  Trump will cause World War III
2963,I don&#39;t see a difference between this and a TNTL vine compilation from 2016
2964,Best debate trump has ever done. Honestly very mature

2981,The Ukraine has Hotter Women than the Israelis.
2982,"Next time it’s gonna directly take place in the retirement home 😂😂😂<br><br><br>As an European this debate is just so absurd and unreal to me that it’s almost funny, but then I remember that these two clowns are potentially gonna be the next president of the US and that’s where it gets sad"
2983,Biden... He&#39;s reading... He literally sounds like he&#39;s reading...
2984,Biden won! Has anyone else ever had trouble speaking with this technology attacking us? I remember vividly when former president Trump was president and had difficulty speaking. We need vice President Kamala Harris to stay home and help with what she has experience in…civil rights against abuse and torture.
2985,"&quot;You ever hear any other President say something like &#39;I&#39;m gonna seek retribution&#39; or &#39;Hitler had great ideas&#39;?&quot; <br><br>No, but I&#39;ve heard a President refer to a group of voters as a racial slur (the only President to ever use a racial slur when referring to American citizens), and he was a Democrat! 🤡"
2986,😂❤
2987,They should have to provide trustworthy data sources with their answers.
2988,I don’t know if I herd it write but did trump say that <br>hamas is invading Israel <br>Cause the only people who are getting killed blown up or having there homes exploded are the people  of palatine
2989,Wow biden!! He needs to go home
2990,Neither one cares about child care
2991,Biden needed half an hour for the Ritalin to kick in.
2992,Two jokes on stage. <br>But at least Trump will stop the invasion<br>Butcher Joe is the worst president in US history. The only good thing he did was raise Social Security. But now he&#39;s destroying SSI by giving it to illegal invaders. <br>We need better than both of these
2993,Biden makes me miss my grandpa
2994,Since when personal attacks are the norms in any debate
2995,Biden needs a medical care 24/7 and let trump take over the United States once and for all.
2996,Trump turning his head looking  at biden is crazy 🦜😂
2997,Why is Joe biden putting blame 🙄<br>On Donald trump for every down fall you were president of united states 🇺🇸 of America 🇺🇸 for 4 years you had all the time ⏲️ to fix all these problems why didn&#39;t you ? Joe.  <br><br>When Joe Biden became the president of united states 🇺🇸 of America 🇺🇸 situations started to unfold literally. 😢
2998,We REALLY NEED true Libertarians in the debates. More options! More candidates.
2999,I’m 20 mins in but so far I noticed Biden lies way more than Trump
3000,🎉TRUMP 🎉😂 at least he knows where he is and can form a coherent sentence
3001,"Biden is the NUMBER 1 , NUMBER 2 guy 😂"
3002,A debate of the highest quality. We can all look forward to a new era of dynamism and fresh ideas.
3003,A convicted felon and sexual predator in a presidential debate.  We are charting new territory.  Integrity and honor  don&#39;t seem to exist anymore.  A sexual predator able to run for the Office of the President???????
3004,The civilization will end soon. Looook who are the candidates for US president 😂 omg is this a joke !?
3005,Kinda feel bad for trump he had fo waste  his time debating this clown.
3006,Prices have NOT dropped with Biden. He is also adding more taxes on imports. That raises prices.
3007,I can&#39;t believe these are the 2 best options this country can come up with.<br>They both lie their butts off.
3008,"Liberal &quot;scholars&quot;.. you can&#39;t be a scholar if you are liberal, on paper yes, philosophically no."
3009,Trump rolls over biden
3010,How tf has he not been impeached. We&#39;re living under the most corrupt government that has ever existed. Why do democrats not realize that the earth has been going through climate changes since it&#39;s existence. So sick of our socialist/communist government. A revolution is long needed.
3011,I think Biden is never done anything to his country <br>Trump is a powerful man <br>❤ we wanted Trump must win God save Trump 😊
3012,Hosts were terrible
3013,"The price of food, of groceries, of rent , absolutely everything has done nothing but go up under biden. Food had more than doubled! <br>Biden and his partye are the most vile corrupt monsters that have ever lied in office."
3014,Feel sorry for Biden. It’s pretty clear. He’s being dried across the finish line and he doesn’t know himself.
3015,Biden looks like one of the Ghosts from the haunted mansion 😂😂😂
3016,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4585"">1:16:25</a> nice fart, Donny."

3021,"Haha, the rest of the world is laughing at the USA because we can&#39;t believe how you still can consider Trump as president and how he is not in jail."
3022,please please please Vote for Trump all of us need to if not we will all be doomed ...
3023,What&#39;s good is you can just fast forward whenever joe speaks.
3024,Watching this instead of the boys
3025,"Hello from Bulgaria 🇧🇬,  there were never been so much corruption, lies from politicians and media and so much despair and poverty into people, how&#39;s  in your country?"
3026,"Creating victims to defend your administration or future economic plan? I&#39;m tired of the Democratic party contaminated by Socialist speech, where they create victims of skin color, victims of price of medication, victims of big companies,  creating victims of genders, yet introducing sexualized books into the children&#39;s school&#39;s libraries, that is their speech self-victimization, the speech of socialist with the tone of communist. America and Americans aren&#39;t victims of none. America is a great nation, their people are hard workers, resilient, unified, entrepreneurial people  that is how it rose to the top of all nations."
3027,"😂”Brandon, just speak to them!” PRESIDENT TRUMP to Bumbling Biden at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1347"">22:27</a>"

3030,He was in France and spoke to all those D-Day hero&#39;s that died.. WOW
3031,The comments section might just be indicative of this upcoming election👀
3032,"Thank you, the real debate no bs intros and voice overs."
3033,&quot;If we finally beat medicare&quot;- Joe Biden
3034,Notice how Biden literally denies everything 😂
3035,the tax system is not fair biden
3036,Both of these guys are not capable to be president. Biden the brain is gone and trump the way he talks about our alias like Europe is scary! He is in love with Russia period and too cocky and talks to much and keeps repeating him self. If there are America&#39;s top candidates we r in trouble for the next 4 years. Better of vote someone else the outcome will be better
3037,"Biden did not come from Scranton😂.  He’s from Delaware, his wife was from Pennsylvania but he’s not.  I’m not sure where that came from"
3038,fake biden
3039,"I feel if Republicans would run anyone but Trump, they would easily win. If Democrats would run anyone but Biden, they would easily win. The worst candidates."
3040,Biden told the biggest lie this evening: Biden said the the border patrol endorsed him and not even 2 minutes later the border patrol&#39;s official twitter tweeted that they never have and never will endorse Joe Biden
3041,democrats 🤝 republicans<br>   &quot;we need better choices&quot;
3042,NATOに加盟しないロシアを使ってNATOを攻撃させるなどと発言した大統領はザユナイテッドステイツオブアメリカ史上おそらくこのプレジデントだけだ。<br>　この前代未聞の態度は当然自国民全体から非難、排斥されるべきだし、発言の意図を推察すればロシアとの癒着と蜜月的関係は明らかなので、ロシアへの機密情報漏洩という罪状だって冤罪ではなく真実だと簡単に確信できる。<br>　その場合は国家的な犯罪に手を染めている人物があろうことか大統領選に再出馬するという国家的な恥辱を各国にさらすことになるので、ザユナイテッドステイツオブアメリカの司法の最高機関（最高裁判所）は<br>勇気を持った決意ある判断を国民の総意の力を借りて下すべきだ。<br>その英断の名は有罪だ。<br><br>Please  transrate in English
3043,This is what Trump meant when he said “Bloodbath” lol
3044,Biden cant evag walk damass
3045,The mediators are too rich to go grocery shopping. If it was up by $20 overall then it’s normal inflation. It’s doubled. Everyone here is a joke. Isn’t it suppose to be a top job? We have such talented people in America and nobody else wants this job ?
3046,Indians thinking about Modiji and Rahul Gandhi😂
3047,Biden:<br>O_o
3048,Why do people keep saying Biden&#39;s mental health is deteriorating? Wasn&#39;t he always like this?
3049,manchurian candiddate 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3050,2 clowns 🤡
3051,Trump who really loves America and American people should be next President in America.
3052,"Ok, guys, the joke isn&#39;t funny anymore.  Who are the real presidential candidates?"
3053,im sick of hearing the word&quot; the idea&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3054,They both lie but almost everything out of Bidens mouth was an easily verifiable lie with simple google searches on his claims.
3055,"Let me put it in a different and more easily understandable way... There was a time in the US where moderate Republicans and Democrats shared common interests together, despite their political and ideological differences. It is THAT order which Trump and his cult followers have shaken up since 2016, followed by the Biden counter-block now which isn&#39;t any better either. It&#39;s bad for the peace of both sides, since they are being taken over by the extreme fringes on either side now, as I said. And this will only create more division domestically.<br><br>By the way, here in Europe and especially in Germany we have experiences over many decades with left-wing and right-wing radicals always at each other&#39;s throats, since neither of them will ever compromise to the other extreme. Hence they are not solving any problems, only creating more chaos. That&#39;s why we have additional political parties in the center in Europe who can tame both sides and introduce common ground and consensus in a professional manner accepted by everyone. They say Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy were such Presidents, to name some American equivalents in history. Bringing lefties and righties together has never been easy though. It&#39;s like mixing salt and sugar. But it can taste good if done correctly!"
3056,I don’t understand what this dude is talking Jesus ( Biden just stop 😅)
3057,"I&#39;m a single white mom, I work full time, no government benefits and I can&#39;t afford to sew a Dr because of copays, my grocery bill, rent has all went up."
3058,"The limited two-party system in tne US now shows its design flaws and vulnerabilities. If you can only have the communist far-left (controlling Biden) or the fascist far-right (acting behind Trump) rule a country now then neither outcome will be beneficial for the majority of people, unless you directly belong to one of the extreme fringes or hold some prestige or power position there. Whether you accept it or not, depending which side you root for, this is the political reality in the US today."
3059,"this debate is rigged. The panel gives Biden the time to respond, but they never give that time to Trump to respond it is always a new question to Trump."
3060,Trump 2024
3061,Ukraine  should not be NATO period!!!!!
3062,This debate was like watching a Lion (Trump) vs a baby gazelle (Biden).
3063,&quot;jobs for Americans from all over the world??&quot; hey joe you have shown  we can&#39;t be trusted
3064,"Poetin wants peace. He was put with his back against the wall with Ukraïne, NATO could come way to close to Russian borders, and also he is protecting those in Ukraïne that are under threat of the other parties in Ukraïne. Both Trump and Biden do not seem to know what is really going on, and I can&#39;t take either seriously."
3065,opoid?/  that due to open borders caused by bidden
3066,I love the way western government run their elections
3067,You have the morals of an alley cat😢😂
3068,Bring back Bernie Saunders!!!!
3069,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1345"">22:25</a> did he call him Brandon 🤣"
3070,But Trump is clearly lying!
3071,Why was a teleprompter allowed
3072,Actually when you listen to Biden yet again..he didn&#39;t perform as badly as some in the comment section put it.
3073,Is this American Got Talents?
3074,They just caught an illegal MS13 terrorist in Maryland last week.
3075,Did anyone see the mediator&#39;s face when President Biden said&quot; Something snapped in you when you lost the last time&quot; and Mr. Trump was smiling? She looked she was fighting hold back laughter. I wondered how on earth those two mediators found the power to maintain their composure through all of this. That&#39;s the resolve America needs to be great.🎉
3076,Dynamic Don vs Sleepy Joe
3077,"President Biden is suffering from something.  You can see it just in the first few minutes of the debate compared to before.<br><br>I am not a doctor, but I know what that looks like.  <br><br>Does it mean he is suffering from Parkinson’s?  Not necessarily.<br><br>There are a lot of things that can look like Parkinson’s.<br><br>Does it mean he needs to be looked at and monitored?  Yes.<br><br>He could just be sick with something. I don’t know because I haven’t watched him over the years.<br><br>People would have to watch him over the next debates and his daily interactions.  You don’t know what he’s dealing with. There might be other forces at play that we just don’t know about.<br><br>I will say this:  I know Exactly what that looks like to me- but again, I am no doctor and I don’t watch the news or TV very much at all.<br><br>The only way to truly know is for him to take levodopa carbidopa and watch what happens.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>- I will say this- if he decides to run again, his aides, his top advisors, and any professors that are in his confidence will be more pronounced, as they Should be anyway.<br>- If he is suffering in silence, you would see (effectively) mostly just his Aides and professors, which ultimately you have to decide if that’s a good or bad thing.<br>- he needs to stay active in order to not get locked up, if it is the case.  He would need therapy (physical, occupational and linguistically) daily, and constant interaction.<br><br>For any person suffering from it, what matters is having meaning and seeing the people that matter most to you.<br>- Other presidents suffered mightily from other neurological diseases with the help of aides and Advisors, Besides their own Vice President."
3078,Trump 2024 🎉🎉🎉
3079,Bring Obama back! Simple..
3080,"As a Veteran, the ability to have the choice to see non-VA care provider when the wait to see a VA care provider is too long was important. These were special circumstances, but important.<br>Now, the VA has been instructed to stop allowing Veterans the choice to be seen by non-VA providers."

3084,Gooooo trump we love you.
3085,Biden looks scary.
3086,Yah we need it cause of all your failures. Biden.
3087,A acutely feel bad for Biden the people pushing him toward need to have a word with them selves seriously 👀 at him it’s over
3088,"N0 this is the worst. Shape we have ever been in, they trust you?? He has lost. It."
3089,"As an international observer and democrat myself I pity Americans in 2024. They have the worst choice to make this year in any presidential election. Mad Trump or Sleepy Joe... Needless to say, you will only be satisified if you belong to the political hardcore base of any of the two candidates, while ignoring the other half 50% of the country. For everyone else in the middle neither choice will do. Meaning right-wing conservatives will love Trump while left-wing progressives will totally be devastated. And the other way round if JB was to be reelected. This will further divide the US domestically, any direction this goes."
3090,"Trumps the best, president. In all history. We love trump.."
3091,"Theres the proof ask the people, then the will tell you..."
3092,"Yah the worst is you. How come he has all the supporters, then. You got none😂😂😂"
3093,Yep
3094,He is so twisted.
3095,He&#39;s smokin biden.
3096,Sure looks like he is listening to someone. With ear phones.
3097,"What have you done? Nothing but destroy our country,"
3098,Omg pitiful.
3099,Sleepy Joe lost that debate all he was trying to do was irritate Trump and get him going and it didn’t work
3100,Biden looks as if he&#39;s seeing the Grim Reaper staying in the corner of the room when he looks up
3101,"CNN have really shown this time how politically ideological they have become over the years and won&#39;t accept any criticism of Joe Biden. The proof is right in front of everyone&#39;s eyes. WSJ and other media outlets allow comments on the presidential debates, even Fox News, but only CNN have closed the comment section from the getgo, which is very unusual for them since they always allow commenting on any topic imaginable out there."
3102,"I’m on Social Security we can barely get by why don’t we cut your wages? Why should you get paid so much more money and live in mansions by the rest of us especially veterans our veterans should be living like Kings and Queens not people like President Biden they should cut their wages and live like we do, lower class part of the rich why don’t you pay more money your pocket? Biden you’re one of the rich you’re not paying more taxes."
3103,"I’m on Social Security we can barely get by why don’t we cut your wages? Why should you get paid so much more money and live in mansions by the rest of us especially veterans our veterans should be living like Kings and Queens not people like President Biden they should cut their wages and live like we do, lower class part of the rich why don’t you pay more money your pocket?"
3104,Food prices and living expenses is up over probably 500% because he’s in office Biden
3105,He’s speaking like an American would speak their opinion and their truth not sugarcoating everything like Biden is doing
3106,"Episode: Dr. Phil: Inside China&#39;s Secret Plan To Control America <br>This is a must watch, EVERYONE!!!! Highly important information for us all!!! Please watch"
3107,this isnt about how terribly performed they did in debate<br>it is about as an american you have only these 2 options - a childish criminal or a walking corpse
3108,I’m sorry that I’m not enjoying this debate and Biden is not convincing me. He is good for this country. Trump was president. We could afford to live people like me that are in the lower class can barely buy food. What is Buy gonna do to fix that get rid of us make us sleep in homeless shelters tents on the streets where they all live in their mansions and I think about the lower class people and making them for things like food and housing. Everything is out of control. I’m pretty sure people are living in the streets. The Democrats are gonna be living in their mansions.
3109,Biden is probably planning to try to win the presidency only to hand over the presidency to Kamala after a month or so...... like his original plan until someone confronted him about his plans!
3110,I’m sorry that I’m not enjoying this debate and Biden is not convincing me. He is good for this country. Trump was president.

3111,Why does Biden keep on slandering Trump? He’s not talking about how to fix the problem. All he is doing is slandering without proof and facts. He’s not doing anything to show how to fix it or say things to Fix it. I don’t think he knows where he’s at.
3112,Why does Biden keep on slandering Trump? He’s not talking about how to fix the problem. All he is doing is slandering without proof and facts. He’s not doing anything to show how to fix it or say things to Fix it. I don’t think he knows where he’s at.
3113,"I can&#39;t believe that CNN has been so hooked into sickdem POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, that it&#39;s producers  DIDN&#39;T KNOW how MENTALLY INCAPACITATED JB is!"
3114,Love you trump
3115,Trump ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
3116,"for around 250 years until somebody changed the laws, yet biden claims because something has been the law for 51 years makes it a good thing.<br>it should be that trump should have said &quot;i will use the same tools that the democrats have made and used, if its good for the goose its good for the gander&quot;"
3117,This like a Netflix episode get da popcorn rdy🍿
3118,"In the bible its up to the father to decide if he wants the baby. If not, the baby is left outside to fend for itself."

3120,"What does Trump mean when he says, &quot;Black jobs&quot;?"
3121,People yes love USA 🇺🇸
3122,"Why is it that when you looking for work, you need to do all sorts of tests and interviews. When you are president, nah brah he old."
3123,america is doomed man
3124,Everytime i look around there stands a Mexican
3125,He installed jobs?! Well how come the Mexicans get a better position in a good job before Americans
3126,Separate from political preferences...<br>... I personally start to worry seeing that Biden has sole power to launches nuclear missiles...
3127,Trump 2025
3128,Somebody please just take Biden home and give him the love and care an elderly deserves
3129,Trump 💪
3130,Demoncrats are something else😅
3131,"I pity you all in the USA if this is your choice,tragic,and sad too"
3132,"One thing is for sure Trump was correct in that most of the world do not respect or look up to America anymore. The seriousness of the problems will take more effort than Biden or his followers can stomach. If they think Jan 6th was bad, wait till they start getting xenophobic attacks. Take it from us that know. Gov can play all the dirty tricks to stay in power until the people just had enough."
3133,"Poor Biden, his face touched my heart. please vote for Biden!! He’s the best"
3134,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2767"">46:07</a> here he actually talks coherently without stuttering or pausing for a good while, almost like being utterly offended is what woke him up lol"
3135,"Americans, uhm... Don’t you have... Uhhh... ANY OTHER PARTIES??"
3136,so American elections are about Dumb vs Dumber presidents. lol
3137,god we&#39;re so cooked
3138,the world is falling apart because of democracy.
3139,"Seriously I woke up depressed and began to read the comments here now I&#39;m having abdominal aches of laughing so much nonstop, thanks y&#39;all!"
3140,The questions aren&#39;t getting answered. Trump has to respond to the ridiculous claims and gets no time to answer questions.
3141,Wake up Joe!!! M.f
3142,"He will not block the pill. If 90 percent of all ab&#39;s are done with the pill,  what&#39;s the problem?"
3143,Biden doesn&#39;t even look like he&#39;s focused. He&#39;s day dreaming and confused
3144,Trump save the world! 2024
3145,"Trump is like SeaBiscuit. <br>He’s banged up a little, but in the end he shows you what he’s made of. A winner."
3146,"Some said Trump was running on the ceiling and spitting, Biden was crawling on the floor and peeing.<br>                                     But in fact, two pensioners are talking about something.<br>                     It would be nice for them to sit next to each other on a bench and gossip."
3147,my favorite part was watching whoever wasn’t talking. i got a good laugh out of the facial expressions

3160,"Both Biden and Trump are horrible options for the president and I&#39;m disappointed in and afraid for this country that these 2 have managed to get this far, Joe Biden isn&#39;t all there and Trump is being charged for dubious activities"

3185,Why is this man still coming back as a presidential  candidate is there no any other person Americans what&#39;s wrong with you
3186,I thought we were watching the miser brothers christmas special
3187,"To be honest Illegal immigration’s impact will blow the fan when in November the package for free hotel and food expires. Biden closed pipeline for energy security, he gave 200 billion to corrupt Zelensky and especially did nothing about crime and homeless people. About inflation is not just 20% in four years, it’s over 120 %. <br>Millions of citizens are in food stamps.<br>Biden has to be replaced as he has cognitive dissonance and couldn’t speak well.<br>Technically he lost what he was speaking over 14 times in this debate"
3188,Biden may be the first president in history with plausible deniability. <br><br>The reason he looks so dumbfounded every time Trump speaks is because this is quite literally the first time he&#39;s hearing any of this information. All he has to go by is what&#39;s drip-fed to him by his personal handlers. They keep him in a bubble of lies and misinformation.
3189,Biden face be like.🥴

Enough of the golf. why don&#39;t they both have a celebrity boxing match? I am sure Mike Tyson would train Trump. idk what else to say for Biden."
3191,Trump is HILARIOUS 😂
3192,If you think all of this foolishness was going on under Trump&#39;s watch then you simply don&#39;t pay attention to your surroundings. The proof is also right in front of your eyes here when you look at Biden make his silly faces and listen the responses coming out of his mouth 😂
3193,MEDIA OF AMERICA MAKING MONEY. MONEY TALKS BECOME SILENT.
3194,"No inflation?! Before Biden came into office, my family would&#39;ve been able to qualify to purchase home ( however, being active duty military at the time we didn&#39;t) ... Now!? (Now that I&#39;ve been retired?) At this rate under Biden, I will be at retiring age before i could come close to qualifying for purchasing a home ... 😤"
3195,I thought this was a presidential debate and not a try not to answer as many questions as possible challenge

3200,"Why does it seem like Biden is constantly having minor strokes while attempting to defend himself, his administration, and/or everything that is questioned on his behalf?"
3201,"I work at a small construction company. The owner is a real nice guy but he’s like 85 years old. Super good man, took care of his wife of over 50 years who had dementia until her final day. <br><br>He always just eats out and very rarely goes to the grocery store. He recently went to the grocery store. A few days later he gave our small crew a $3.50 per hour raise. <br><br>I’ve worked there about 30 years. I thanked him for the pay increase. He teared up and said he was sad to see the state of our country and we’re family and have to look out for each. I agreed fully and told him we are family."
3202,"The USA is not the largest Polluters.

3225,Hahaha. It was an insurrection? They turned over desks and broke doors and knocked down statues. That is what Joe Biden said happened. Sounds like trespassing and vandalism at worst.
3226,Biden talks so proudly about his &quot;well-done job&quot; because he talks from the Satanist perspective which is creating chaos and suffering nonstop for all of humanity.
3227,✅️🏥
3228,Iko starlen hiteler laporan sawt palu hee trump buku❤
3229,"I can&#39;t with Biden&#39;s confused expressions staring into space, them calling each other suckers and  Biden calling Trump a whiner. This feels like a Black Mirror comedy episode of two jokers for core world leaders. I hate to have more to make fun of about Biden. Biden also reminds me of the meme &quot;When you had a dream and the dream and you had a dream that you&quot;"

3238,im having fun laughing at literally everyone related to this but then i remember i live in this country
3239,🎉
3240,We’re also in a situation where!!
3241,MAGACNN will not tell you but I will. At the debate the questions were changed at the last minute. Biden was never told but  Trump knew the answers because he knew it was happening. This would throw off anyone&#39;s game plan for a debate. Cnn CEO is one of the mega donors for the Trump campaign.
3242,These two both need to retire instead of squabling on public TV
3243,The idea …. The idea …… the idea …….<br><br>Joe this is the first time you’ve had ANY idea
3244,"Sorry to say, but my bank account had more money in it when Trump was in office. Biden, I&#39;m struggling to keep money in my account. That says something to me. Gas went back up the first week,  Biden took office."
3245,"It is really funny, how they call each other: <br>“ This guy “."
3246,This is dull
3247,Biden is showing characteristics similar to my mother who had dementia
3248,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1421"">23:41</a> that is not a presidential look😂"
3249,THE IDEA
3250,"Biden had over 1 week to prepare for this, what&#39;s more: HE set all the parameters of the debate (who would do it, who could participate (not RFK Jr), how long to respond, 2 breaks (never in past presidential debates) &amp; HE KNEW ALL THE QUESTIONS BEFOREHAND!!! Plus he was obviously medicated &amp; REFUSED TO TAKE A DRUG TEST BEFORE THE DEBATE. In my opinion he did very well (just like his wife said in the tone you&#39;d use for a 3 year old), the best he could. I&#39;m talking about his performance only - not his policies - which are clearly meant to destroy the USA (good follower of the WEF anti-USA &amp; anti-human agenda). I think Trump could have performed better by being more specific about the economy &amp; his accomplishments. In fact, I don&#39;t understand what the left thinks Trump lied about?? I didn&#39;t hear any lies from Trump, but I did from Biden. Anyone surprised by Biden&#39;s demeanor and behavior has clearly been watching the wrong media - it&#39;s been abundantly documented for YEARS. Ask yourslef if you need a new news source because you are not getting the truth. Strangest comment: Biden saying women (need abortion) bc of being raped by their &quot;in laws and sisters!&quot;  Sure, that happens in HIS family (showers with 12 year old Ashley), but thankfully few people can relate to that. Biden looks like he had a stroke; when he smiled 1/2 his face was paralyzed but no one mentions that."
3251,Let&#39;s go Brandon
3252,Joe Biden parece un robot.
3253,😂 anyways I like trump. <br>His audacity is second to none
3254,The amount of times Biden says &quot; the idea...&quot; Reminds me of the chart of transitions my writing teacher showed me 😂
3255,ths 2 men were so cool when were young that  it&#39;s easy to  forgive all this  light nightmare
3256,Go Biden 💙
3257,Trump speak loud and clear. Biden can&#39;t explain anything. I dont understand him. Make trump win and let him stop the war. Make the world great again
3258,Now USA &quot;presidents&quot; &quot;debating over&quot; who is better at Golf!
3259,They compete over who is the worst!!<br>How ironic...
3260,Who came to the comments before the comedy?
3261,I&#39;m irish and living in ireland and I can even see ans say trump done good for America I hope he wins
3262,A couple of old heads why do we have old heads running this country GET A Millennial in office! Or vote independent this reminds me of the 5th grade debates in elementary school. Why are senior citizens running? Go retire and let the millennials take over!

3275,Trump is a troll period 😂😂😂😂😂
3276,Y president Biden looking at papers…@6.12. Hope the interview is not scripted??
3277,"trump for the win, biden go home and sleep"
3278,POTUS NEVER LOST HIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT!
3279,Trump is projecting his own plans onto Biden about WW3
3280,"Dana, why didn’t you ask Trump about his mental illness?"
3281,"Trump did NOTHING when MBS killed and dismembered a reporter, and he’s saying we won’t pay hostage holders!"
3282,Yooooooo some balablue for Nigerians…. 😂😂😂
3283,"Format: Trump lies, Biden protests it, CNN says, “Ok, thank you President Biden!”"
3284,I don&#39;t think Biden helped his campaign.
3285,15 minutes in when Trump said the vote is up to the people on that topic. Biden shakes his head
3286,"After watching a second time, I think POTUS BIDEN will be our finest president ever!"
3287,Good luck  Americans😂
3288,"Seems like the only thing Biden could do is use fake quotes that make Trump look bad when he wasn&#39;t mumbling and rambling.  Trump said this, Trump said that.  All lies.  Why would the moderators only allow Biden time to respond and never allow Trump to respond to the lies Biden was saying about Trump? This was sad to watch, how can anyone take Biden seriously?"
3289,Trump also had teams of people at NY trial claiming NYC is corrupt! So what that 19 people say you didn’t say it!
3290,"How can Tapper and Bash allow Trump to call Biden a liar without reminding Trump of his 30,000+ lies he told in first term?"
3291,"Since Biden, I have ACA, rural internet service, and a boost in SS benefits."
3292,"<b>One of these two mad jokers, control America and world???</b>"
3293,One partially losing it and one is full of himself. 😂😂😂.
3294,How did we get here with these two 🤦🏻‍♀️
3295,Trump is repeatedly ignored for all of his lies.
3296,Я в шоке..
3297,"Biden answered the question, Dana"
3298,"The neutrals would be the greatest beneficiaries of this entertainment, oh its a debate!"
3299,"&quot;You&#39;re wrong&quot;......&quot;No, you&#39;re wrong&quot;.....Pointless &quot;debate&quot;"
3300,Actually Biden is one of our best POTUS’ ever!
3301,"If this is Biden with a cold, He’s OUR MAN!"
3302,Trump CONSTANTLY bulldozes Biden and CNN says nothing!
3303,“I did nothing wrong …” Trump’s most repeated claim. Doesn’t that say enough?
3304,"Biden is accustomed to dealing with at least sanity, not complete lies and gaslighting"
3305,"With all due respect, but I thought we in Bulgaria have to regularly choose between bad and worse. I guess we are not alone. 🙂"
3306,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2460"">41:00</a>, Trump’s lie is absolutely overlooked by CNN! Disgraceful!"
3307,US politics is pure popcorn right now.
3308,Why wasn&#39;t the question asked?How much has joe biden made in politics and how much trump has lost
3309,Crazy how “They not like us” has more views than this
3310,So Americans have 2 choices worse or worst  by default trump gets my vote
3311,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1500"">25:00</a>, Biden is stunned into combatting lie after lie!"
3312,Maybe leaving the comments section open will give WSJ an insight to what the people want. Maybe!
3313,"“Rip the baby out of the womb!” But, Trump did better, huh? Please wake up and choose the sane one!"
3314,Just answer the questions.
3315,"39mins in &amp; I can&#39;t watch anymore.  This is an absolute joke. America, if you vote this guy in again you should be ashamed, a sad day for democracy 😥"
3316,USA is lucky we have the Legislative and Judicial Branches so either candidate wont burn down the country.  <br><br>I cant wait for the VP debate
3317,Greetings from Europe
3318,JB didn’t even know he was at the debate.
3319,Trump shook his head to turning civil rights over to the states! Wasn’t that called the Confederacy?
3320,"Even though, I’m not a US citizen <br>And I have no right to say anything <br>But mr biden is a joke and have no idea what he’s talking about seriously I can’t believe how Americans vote for him honestly. I used to be a student back in the days in the states, and I love this country but what I don’t like is how the system run seems to me like personal issues comes all together against the country itself. Good luck Americans I hope this time you guys make a right decision and choose mr trump ✋"
3321,"Lying, lying, lying! And people still want him in charge! A lying narcissist, and you people think he’s better!"
3322,Someone is speaking to biden and in his ear. Watch him  he&#39;s listening
3323,"Oh, &amp; finally, at 78 &amp; 81 neither of these should be in charge of such a powerful nation."
3324,"I’m not trying to make this seem like a joke in anyway, this is a very serious situation. . But the only thing that I got out of this is that Biden gave some serious privileges..money and in education. To black people. I’ve been sleeping in my car working hot and I cannot afford a place to sleep.  . The blue collar world is hurting with this immigration. . What’s going on is insane."
3325,“Trillions of dollars coming back to our country…” ? Trillions left into the wealthiest’s pockets.
3326,Mr. Trump sounds more convincing and trustworthy
3327,"&quot;He&#39;s right, he did beat Medicare he beat it to death&quot;<br>Trump🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣"
3328,"For all yall watching, if you want to kn ow what dementia looks like just take Bidens face for most of the debate and youy have that, trump 2024"
3329,FOR THE LOVE of God get this BIDEN CHARACTER OUT OF OFFICE!!!!!!!!!<br>AMERICA IS DYING!
3330,"If Trump told people to be violent, why haven’t to seen a single video of him saying that. He said to go there peacefully for crying out loud lol"
3331,"Trump, the UK sees you as an embarrassment &amp; dangerous to be in power.  You have made America a circus."
3332,"I’m honestly ashamed of the United States, two old men, older than Putin, are fighting for power, have you lost your mind?"
3333,FJB TRUMP2024
3334,FJB
3335,"Biden is clearly now too slow in mind to be President again and Trump isnt the one we&#39;d have to fear if he got into office, congress will keep him in check, its the millions of right wing supporters he attracts who mascerad as &quot;patriots.&quot; Both men should be excluded from being president, America is screwed with either one of these men in office and possibly the entire globe."
3336,"Joe Biden WILL and has said he will Expire Trumps Tax Cuts in 2025. That means EVERY Tax Bracket WILL go UP. So, Biden is Lying AGAIN! Biden wants to Increase Tax Spending to $5 TRILLION per year. That means EVERYONE WILL feel the PAIN..!"
3337,America - is humiliation of human kind lately. And funny thing is that this humiliation of a country controls Europe.
3338,Trump is coming back with a new strategy
3339,"I don&#39;t care what Biden did for the last 50 years, nobody deserves this. This is down right elder abuse."
3340,I think that president represents it people very well.<br><br>We have old marazmatic in USA<br>We have clown in Ukraine<br>We have best president in the world - Putin.
3341,"love the exchange of insult. best comedy movie. There is nothing better than watching old men exchange insults hhh. Regardless of the nonsense. With Biden health and aging man, I still would not vote for Trump. Trump is not a good choice for America. He&#39;ll bring more problems than solutions."
3342,Biden too old for this job. Trump is totally mocking this guy.
3343,President Biden clearly won this debate. President Biden had specific answers to specific questions. President Trump was not specific with his answers to questions and seemed to evade the questions. There&#39;s nothing wrong with President Biden cognitively.
3344,"Populism. Always blame on immigrants or the colored. Here, &quot;migrants.&quot; Never touch on the fundamental cause."
3345,"The people of this country should let both of these men retire and spend their old age relaxing with their family in their final years, NOT trying to run a country. This responsibility is too much for these guys. People in America are not being kind to continue voting for, endorsing and pushing these elderly men who are obviously tired, to run an entire country. Please people help figure out a way to pick two other people: N. Haley vs K. Harris? <br>Let these men rest"

3347,Something is wrong in this debate i keep ended up here😅
3348,"I know what Biden is doing I saw it in 2016 in my country. He plays the victim and can emotionally influence the electorate. If Trump tries to humiliate him, he will lose sympathy. People sympathize with the wounded, not with the tricksters. So regardless of whether it&#39;s natural or fake, Biden can win if Trump doesn&#39;t stop humiliating his opponent. He didn&#39;t and I hope he will not, he is a smart guy."
3349,I activated subtitles and it can&#39;t recognise when biden speaks😩😩😔
3350,What a time to be fluent in English meus Amigos 😂😂😂😂 what a time 😂
3351,AMERICA is a large Democratic country and PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE is a charm. We LOVE USA.💛❤💚
3352,USA needs two other candidates in the race
3353,"Trump won, that&#39;s clear,but his position about war in Ukraine is too naive, i mean there&#39;s no way that putin and zele will make peace. You need to choose Rus or Ukr, that&#39;s all. And Biden in that spectacular moment was right when he said politics doesn&#39;t work like that."
3354,bring back Regan even though he is dead
3355,What Lala land does Biden and his staff live in? We aren’t senile like him and we remember how good things were under the Trump Administration and how bad things have been under Biden the last 4 years!
3356,I enjoyed that debate. Trump did way more better than he did 2020 and 2016

3372,He&#39;s not going to cut social security. That&#39;s what every Democrat says to keep themselves in office.
3373,And there&#39;s no such thing as climate change
3374,"I can&#39;t believe your best argument is that Biden appears weak and confused, stumbling over his words and losing his train of thought. In comparison, Trump is a far superior president. He lost the battle within 9 mins of him chatting."
3375,The Waffle House has found it’s new host
3376,Just imagine if there was a live audience during the debate ? Joe wouldve walked hand waving towards them mid way thru the debate Recognising some Dead ppl amongst the audience 😂😂

3378,Most stupid are those who will vote Trump!😠<br>But i dont mean Biden...😖<br>Make it Michelle Obama instead🤗<br>Or somebody else that has a good heart...
3379,Biden resting face is traumatizing 😟
3380,Are they the only options available?
3381,I feel sorry for Biden. It&#39;s sad when people make fun of him. He&#39;s an old man and needs a retirement. I hope USA will have better candidates after 4 years.
3382,Granny vs Annoying orange
3383,Biden putting up big lies to begin the debate.
3384,"Poor cnn, the only time they get ratings is watching the guy they&#39;ve been lying about and support for years get absolutely lambasted 😂"
3385,"Oh man...  With those two options, I can only imagine how hard this must be on the voter. Those parties can&#39;t be serious"
3386,"There were some moments where Biden definitely botched some things up. However, you may say I am in denial, but I still will be voting Blue, because I support Biden, the Democrats, and what they stand for and embody. If there were another choice, perhaps I wouldn&#39;t vote Blue, but truth is I only have two options.<br><br>Trump may be more articulate than Biden, and slightly better at talking, but I will not vote for him, because I vote based on ideas. Biden and the Dems have better ideas than Trump.<br><br>It is a shame to watch two grown, old men bicker back and forth and hurl insults."
3387,we are cooked🙁
3388,Trump Tells Truth ❤
3389,We were better off with Trump before Biden injected his corrupt self
3390,Just gonna listen to this on the way home and NOT look at the comments.<br><br>Just gonna add that your vote doesn’t matter. Look into divide and conquer strategy. Ok bye.
3391,Trump🎉🎉🎉🎉

3393,Trump : liar
3394,"pfff.. is it me or Trump does not answer straight and clear with proposals and direction to any single question? all I hear from him is no data backed up sentences and he just keeps using his time to attack the opponent. I mean, I am already amazed that someone with criminal  harges can be running for President but still, if you really are running, wouldn’t it be wise to make with a worked and defined program?"

3428,"I&#39;m 14, whoever gets elected will be my last childhood president 💀"
3429,Why don&#39;t they just answer the questions straight? I thought these people are Americans?
3430,President Biden might not be able to have more voice  when he speaks in the near future if that is his highest vocal voice.
3431,which country does biden think is the greatest economy?<br>also Biden is president so is he saying he made sure America isn&#39;t the greatest economy?
3432,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2880"">48:00</a> is scary. They have more lined up to ensure he&#39;s going to jail because he&#39;s running for president."
3433,Why CNN didn’t insist on the question if they will recognise PALESTINE 🇵🇸 as a state? 😡
3434,Can anyone give reasoning with actual facts of why trump is/was a bad president.
3435,"This is really sad,  Biden is absolutely in no condition to run anything 😢  not even today, let alone another 4 years !<br><br>Almost appears as elder abuse !<br><br>He should be retired to enjoy what time he has left in peace , without all this stress and expectations, he seems to be forced  to follow."
3436,Trump; &quot;this war should never been started&quot;.. I would say CORRECT!

3443,GROAN  The childish name calling by Biden.  This is an utter embarrassment.  The facilitators did a good job.
3444,"Listen to The Real Debate, where Robert Francis Kennedy Jr- independent candidate for 2024 elections, responds to the two who CNN hosted, and presents his solutions.<br><br>RFK jnr is the nephew of JF Kennedy, who was president in the 50s and 60s. <br>Check out The Real Debate to see him in the debate alongside Trump and Biden, using the Internet tech to skip over CNN and the two parties trying to exclude him, smear him, and pretend he doesn&#39;t exist. <br><br>He was the best debater by far, actually having intelligent solutions about the real issues we are facing. For example - Americans have had a 22 percent hike in home insurance and are paying $4 for a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread and $6 for a gallon of gas, then he added: &quot;It&#39;s because of the forever wars and out-of-control spending by these two gentlemen ... this is the reason they need me on stage, because I will confront them with what they did.&quot;<br>See for yourself - <br><a href=""https://www.kennedy24.com/the-real-debate"">https://www.kennedy24.com/the-real-debate</a>"

3446,"In France, the leftists have won the legislative elections. The country is doomed. Same in UK.<br>Please USA, don&#39;t follow the same path."

3476,BIDEN IS SO COOKED 💀 Trump 2024

3496,"The last bit- Trump hit the nail on the head.<br>Putin didn&#39;t take land under Trump. He took land under Bush, Obama and Biden.<br>Weak men aren&#39;t feared. Biden is a weak man."
3497,Trump is right. WE pay for the worlds woes. We pay for everything when others get to pay nothing or next to nothing.
3498,"Biden couldn’t even pronounce the name of one of the main cities in the Ukraine war, Kyiv, the capital. He must not actually care."
3499,Biden is a war criminal
3500,From what I seen while trump was president everywhere I looked folks were building and having new and more ways to get money. While Biden been president I see inflation and illegal immigrants getting everything.
3501,Glad to see Trump will be in the oval office again.
3502,Don&#39;t believe your own eye&#39;s

3504,Biden choked along with his watching voters.

3510,"Breathe, Joe, breathe, don&#39;t die yet.  You can kick the bucket after you lose the election."
3511,I think mr. biden watches his favorite clint eastwood movies on the daily
3512,Technically it’s the 44th and 45th president of the United States. Still surprises me that the official documents are still wrong on this.
3513,"Biden said around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1575"">26:15</a> that he spoke with &quot;all those heroes that died&quot; at the D-Day memorial 😂"

3516,"Biden&#39;s mouth going to fast for his brain.  Biden looks like somebody just stole his puppy.  Biden squeaking again wake up Joe.  Biden mumble, mumble, mumble.  Biden is super generous with my tax dollars.   All the constitutional lawyers on youtube said the case should never have been brought and after it was brought they all said the case should be dropped, and they all said how can you convict someone without a unanimous decision.  the judge told the jury you don&#39;t need a unanimous decision to convict him."

President Joe Biden said in present debate as he is running for President now  that a number of Republicans want to end Social Security.

Treat them to cake.<br><br> 3. Treat them to cookies.  Democratic friends came.  Joe goes into the kitchen and reads:<br><br> 1. Drink tea.  He brings tea into the room, everyone drinks.  He goes back to the kitchen and reads:<br><br> 1. Drink tea.  They are drinking tea again.<br><br> And so 6 times.  After this, the Democratic friends say goodbye and leave.<br><br> Already on the street one of them says:<br><br> - Biden is very bad.

3691,"This angers me so much Biden is saying that Trump is the only one that believes that we had the greatest economy under his presidency. I was a lower income lower class if you would like to call it that that because of Trump and his policies and because of the economy during his presidency, my life had, a hopeful and pleasant future ahead of me. Once he came into office, Biden stripped me of everything I ever had. I lost everything because of his policies I was literally homeless. I can’t afford to feed my family. I have to work three jobs just to make ends meet Biden is the worst president I have ever experienced during my lifetime, I believe that he is for himself that he is selfish that he is a scared wussy baby that he is incompetent and that he needs to go. I want Trump back because my life was awesome when he was president and I’m coming from the lower end of society that had a chance to make it in this world Because of Biden, I’m hopeless. <br>Bring Trump back!!!!!"

3699,"Biden can&#39;t count jobs for Americans if it illiguels are getting these jobs, and you can&#39;t count bounce back jobs, and you can&#39;t count jobs after he lost 3 tomes more jobs before he gave them back to the illiguels."

3741,Anyone that cares for this President needs to let him spend the last days he could possibly enjoy in peace. His wife is truly abusive. You can see the fear in his eyes. <br>I despise the thought of Trump but can’t vote for a man incapable of simple sentences.

3750,He must have said “the idea” at least 50 times
3751,可惜我没有投票权，不然我一定给特朗普投一票，这哥们太逗了
3752,"The Trump presidency was making America stronger, jobs and economy were steadily improving for the first three years. He did have a tendency to say whatever was on his mind when he shouldn’t have spoke so impulsively. But  even his ridiculous comments weren’t as embarrassing to this country has the things Biden says. We didn’t look weak in the eyes of the world like we do now! And Trump certainly didn’t even come close to running  up the deficit spending that the current administration has. Covid crashed the economy here just as it did in countries all across the world. The over the top scare tactics and ridiculous mandates with the closures of businesses shut our economy down. Not Trump!!!!"

3789,"This is absolute cinema. Ordered, no arguments do more of this."

3791,"Gosh!... I don´t understand 50% words Biden says!! And this is the person who has his finger on BUTTON?!? The guy who can launch warheads? When he cannot pronounce a single word without effort??? Greatest country in the world has this leader? ..... NO COMMENT<br><br>Did B just said: &quot;..sucker, looser&quot;???

I’m not a millionaire by any stretch of the imagination.  I do see illegal immigrants being dropped off at my small town train station because Chicago refuses to take anyone else.  Who’s that helping?  Dropping a bunch of folks who don’t have money, family or any resources off at a train station in the middle of no where with a train ticket going somewhere else.  I feel sorry for these folks.  They ain’t got nothing and have been promised the world and get dumped off to fend for themselves.  Why bring them in?"

3884,Ok
3885,"It isn’t a sin to become older and not be as sharp as one once was.  Biden is showing obvious signs of aging, losing his train of thought, stumbling and looking confused and lost, etc.… that happens to all of us… but he is the leader of our Country… we can’t afford to have a person leading our Country that is suffering with a mental decline occurring. I have no respect for Jill Biden who would insist that he’s fit to serve.  If she loves him, she should do the right thing which would be to encourage him to hand over the torch.  Everyone, including other leaders can see for themselves… I will admit the choice we have is tough, but Biden is struggling more and more.  It’s like he is trying to prove something.  He needs to step down while he still has respect from the people."

4012,"Hitler and Trump similarities:<br><br>Use of Propaganda:<br><br>Hitler: Utilized propaganda extensively to spread Nazi ideology, control public perception, and demonize opponents. Joseph Goebbels, his Minister of Propaganda, played a key role in this.<br><br>Trump: Frequently used social media and rallies to communicate directly with his base, often bypassing traditional media. He also labeled mainstream media as &quot;fake news&quot; to undermine their credibility.<br><br>Populist Rhetoric:<br><br>Hitler: Promoted a nationalist agenda, blaming Jews and other minorities for Germany&#39;s problems and promising to restore Germany to its former glory.<br><br>Trump: Used populist themes, emphasizing &quot;America First,&quot; and often blamed immigrants, foreign nations, and political elites for America&#39;s issues.<br><br>Charismatic Leadership:<br><br>Hitler: Cultivated a strong, authoritative image, presenting himself as the savior of Germany.<br><br>Trump: Presented himself as a strong leader who could fix the country’s problems, often portraying himself as an outsider fighting against a corrupt establishment.<br><br>Scapegoating:<br><br>Hitler: Blamed Jews, communists, and other groups for Germany&#39;s economic and social woes, leading to severe persecution.<br><br>Trump: Frequently blamed immigrants, particularly from Mexico and Muslim-majority countries, as well as political opponents for various issues facing the United States.<br><br>Rallying Support through Mass Gatherings:<br><br>Hitler: Organized large rallies, such as those in Nuremberg, to energize his supporters and project power.<br><br>Trump: Held frequent rallies across the country to maintain enthusiasm among his base and project strength.<br><br>Disdain for Democratic Norms:<br><br>Hitler: Exploited the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic’s democratic system to gain power and ultimately dismantle it.<br><br>Trump: Criticized various democratic institutions and norms, including questioning the legitimacy of elections and the integrity of the judicial system"

4053,This is sad to watch. Joe looks tired
4054,Regret my late opinion. Pres. Biden had not been unsteady during the debate. The problem is that he stutters. Everybody knows that. He is not the only one with that impediment. He has done a wonderful job so far  and should be given the opportunity to continue.
4055,Bruh they talking about absolutely nothing we doomed either way I’m not voting for

4114,Joe Biden &amp; Jill are a joke
4115,That&#39;s a lie Biden. My father had everything he needed by the VA in Trump 4 yrs until Biden was elected. My father was retired veteran Army. So yes Biden you did cute back on the VA care known fact and living spouse my mother that was married to the veteran!

4123,"I like the ad pauses, Joe has that open mouth and thousand yard stare he&#39;s known for"
4124,"Question # 1 of the debate was about inflation.<br><br>The very first words out of Biden&#39;s mouth were lies....<br><br>1). &quot;Well, You got to take a look at what I was left when I became President. What Mr. Trump left me.&quot;<br><br>Fake! The condition of the economy was not due to Trump, but due to the pandemic and due to Governor&#39;s who mandated the closing of businesses in their states. He was not responsible for that condition other than to say it would have been worse had he not done the things he did. &quot;What Mr. Trump left me&quot; suggests that what was left was of his doing and it absolutely was not.<br><br>2). &quot;We had an economy that was in free fall&quot;<br><br>Lie - people were starting to get vaccines in December and things were  already rapidly returning to normal by late January. Things weren&#39;t falling, they were rising.<br><br>3). &quot;The pandemic was so badly handled, many people were dying and all he said was &#39;it&#39;s not that serious, just inject a little bleach into your arm you&#39;ll be alright.&quot;<br><br>Objectively-Lie, Lie, Lie<br>A. The pandemic wasn&#39;t mishandled. They did try their best, supplying the CDC with the resources to do it&#39;s work. Doctors, not politicians lead the response. If social distancing and masking were not effective I wouldn&#39;t blame the administration or even the medical scientists who were limited in what could be done. There was no great silver bullet they missed. A great and effective grand thing that would make all the difference. It was small things that had small impacts.<br><br>B. Many people were dying, that&#39;s true. But anything that comes after the statement of &quot;all he said&quot; would be a deliberate misrepresentation unless it contained ALL of what he said.<br><br>C. The statement he attributed to him was nothing even remotely close to what he said... and it wasn&#39;t even based on something he said. It was based on a question he asked someone while not addressing the press. Something he found interesting. That statement was a complete lie and deliberately misleading anyone who heard it. Trump never even used the word bleach. He did use the word disinfectant. A person with a virus is infected. To disinfect a person infected with a virus is to inject an antiviral medication. A virus killer. Antivirus is a disinfectant because it comes in contact with a virus and the virus dies. Antibodies attack infections. The therapy monoclonal antibodies used man made proteins that acted like antibodies in that they bound to the virus and destroyed it. As they disinfected an infected person, and it was an IV injection, they actually did inject people with a type of disinfectant.<br><br>4. &quot;The economy collapsed. There were no jobs&quot;<br><br>Absolutely FALSE!!! Businesses couldn&#39;t hire because no one wanted to work. Businesses had to struggle to get staff to return as he was taking office. TONS of jobs, no people.<br><br>5. &quot;The unemployment rate rose to 15%&quot;<br><br>Lie.... he asked us to look at what he left us. Joe took office late January of 2021, did he not? The month of January 2021 had a 6.3% unemployment rate and was coming down nearly half a percent (.4%). Not as bad as Joe states it and improving. The rebound had begun. The difference between 6.3% and 15% is HUGE!!! Double the 6.3 to 12.6% and you are still way off by thousands and thousands.<br><br>If you wanna say he wanted to say that&#39;s how bad it once was, he should also give Trump credit for getting it from 15% down to 6.3%. But as you listen, the intent was to make Biden look like he was the one that conquered the 15% unemployment obstacle. No, he spent trillions taking us from 6.3 to around 4%. His goal was to make his achievement look better than it was.<br><br>* Next was some pointless words with no claims.<br><br>6. &quot;We created 15,000 new jobs&quot;<br>               😯<br>I put that face because of his next statement:<br><br>&quot;We brought out...<br>(Ahem)<br>In a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs&quot;<br><br>False. This can&#39;t be accurate... if you have 800,000 NEW manufacturing jobs, how can you have only created 15,000 jobs? Which one is false because we aren&#39;t that bad at math that we can&#39;t see one or both are fake numbers. You can&#39;t call it truth.<br><br>PS: Giving government contracts from money the government doesn&#39;t have and thus spending tomorrow&#39;s money now is robbing future tax collections. That enlarges the money supply.... that&#39;s how you caused the inflation. <br><br>He actually gave one of the answers to thr question here... we created jobs with government money. It&#39;s the people who took these jobs and spent their paychecks buying stuff that caused inflation.<br><br>Good luck in getting him to acknowledge they over stimulated the economy and that did it. He&#39;s probably not smart enough to know that."
4125,"trump didnt win, biden simply lost the debate. trumps lies could have been beaten."

Look at my success! This guy sucks&#39; while the referees just try to get them to actually wrestle. It just makes me sad, idec anymore, politics are just trash in America"
4132,No one believes Biden anymore about what experts say as we know he he lied about hunters  laptop.
4133,Cnn is still favorably to Biden.  They let biden have the last talk
4134,"In Starting of debate, It seems like Biden had mugged up his answers like a nerdy kid before an school debate competition."

Im not entirely sure if that sentence was said correctly but i would like to dig a little more into these candidates other than their surface level arguments in order to make a logical and educated vote on who i want to run the country. Where can i find informarion about their, with lack of better words, &quot;pushing policies&quot; or &quot;campaigning policies&quot;. Also are these sources reputable? I appreciate your responses."
4139,Debate in Jewish CNN 😅😅😅 vote for Putin for US president 😅😅😅

I USED TO BUY CHICKEN LEGS AT 99c a POUND. now they’re $20 for only a measly few pounds. we can’t even afford chicken breast because it was $25 for only a small pack at Costco. It used to be $5 a pound—even $2/lb if you had a fareway. Costco is KNOWN for giving big packs of stuff. That pack of chicken was tiny.

Even if Biden had given the worst speech ever,he was very accurate and tried to answer to all of the questions carefully, that&#39;s why before all of you will hate and bully him please think about it,for example if I could I voted for him,but I am a teenager that&#39;s why can&#39;t do it,but you guys can that&#39;s why think before you will make a right decision ❤"

4159,Biden is just trolling
4160,Do America mean nobody is better than Biden or what 😮
4161,Trump is good on microphone. Under him I had respect for America but under Biden I lost that respect because I don&#39;t see any reason why they keep pumping ammunition into Ukraine instead of dialogue between the two countries to find solution and avoid that war. It could be avoided and thousands of lives would have been saved today.

4181,"Let&#39;s go, Brandon! 😮"
4182,Covid 19 hurt the economy. Shut down no jobs no income. The economy business was hurt. We as Americans hurt. As result. When economy restarted of course inflation happens to reboot economy. Job rebooted. As normal. Thank god for getting back to normal. We give the government to much credit for change or lack of. Yet we dont trust them but expect them to help us when we down. Yet some people haven&#39;t made personal changes to help themselves. Pick ur battles. The middle remain in the middle maintaining. Always takes care of each other. Trump is before and mid covid and biden is post covid. Measure the change and focus of the next 4yrs. Realistic change over depending on the wealthy to bail is out . We are the bail out. Who will make the rich pay?
4183,"Biden, as the daughter of a combat vet who died from burn pit cancer from Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, sister of a combat vet in Afghanistan, and a retired Navy vet, I can assure you, the military hates you and what your administration did to the military."

4206,"I thought learning something through this political debate, instead laughed to death...  Politicians are politicians and are same everywhere."
4207,I wish Trump had said more about his tax cuts cutting EVERYONE&#39;S taxes. It raised standard deductions which puts one in a lower bracket. Lower tax brackets pay lower taxes.<br>Child tax credits

4220,This debate made trump actually look likable and Biden look like he had a stroke; most of what biden said didn&#39;t even make sense.
4221,"it&#39;s wild biden wan&#39;ts to tax the top rich, you can&#39;t just peoples money away like that they worked for that money/life"
4222,Lol biden said the unemployment rate was 50% under trump and inflation was 0 because no one was working. Thats plain wrong and makes NO SENSE. Inflation is PURELY and ONLY from too much currency in a market. It has nothing to do with jobs

4224,Number 1. I think Biden has big problem staying longer than 15 minutes. Number 2. To participate in debate is a big physical challenge to him. Number 3. What drives Biden in politics is possibility to lie with no legal consequence.
4225,"This is the man dealing with putin, xi, and mbs. Yeah..."
4226,so basically we&#39;re doomed
4227,Biden is 100% delusional

4235,Shame on Biden and his team
4236,"I&#39;m a waitress in Canada at a diner. Most of my customers are seniors. I see alot of talk on U.S. news about Biden&#39;s age being a problem, but age is not the problem.. however if a president has dementia then this is a big problem! There&#39;s many of my senior customers who are very intelligent people. I guess I worry that people will get biased towards older people."

4246,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=511"">8:31</a> Biden face😮"
4247,"Trump was speaking facts, once again. Stop letting media manipulate you. This is like hip hop vs mumble rap"
4248,Our choices for president in 2024: <br><br>1) A disrespectful old man that fuels hate and division.<br>2) An old man that has no idea where he’s at.
4249,What about CHILD CARE?!!! if neither of them have a solution for this then I’m not voting.
4250,The truth is you don&#39;t even have to watch the debate to make a decision. This is the first time in American history where a debate is irrelevant. Even Joes own party knows he can not continue to serve as president... and nobody wants him. Americans don&#39;t want him!
4251,That guy don’t even blink
4252,"Did anyone notice Dana’s eyes at trump at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=165"">2:45</a>.  😍❤!!!! Check it out and reply what you think"
4253,Trump is a liar
4254,Biden needs to win to save are country
4255,"Why are we still letting old folks lead us? Joe looks like he&#39;s about to have a seizure every time Donald speaks. We&#39;re the reason why we&#39;ll never see progress in any country. None of these presidents can ever account for their actions in 30+ years. How can we expect anything from people who are about to kick the bucket, bonkers! They busy try&#39;nna make sure their bucket list well stock before its off. Wild."
4256,this is thew worst HAHA
4257,Biden must not be DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
4258,&#39;I skibidi with&#39;
4259,What?... is going on? Is there no speech class of any kind?  pronunciation? spelling? you&#39;re telling me there was no vocal training done for Biden at all? intonation... vowel...
4260,so this is how our generation shutting down the greatest country in whole history. By watching two grandpa chatting nonsenses.
4261,"These comments tell the truth. If biden wins, something really isn&#39;t right"
4262,&quot;And by the way&quot;....😂😂😂😂😂
4263,He&#39;s a lie
4264,Biden was a fool to debate without fact checkers as trump makes up lies on the fly
4265,every decision biden makes is to our detriment .he is china&#39;s puppet .paid for.
4266,Biden looks funny
4267,👇🏻team trump
4268,my comment keeps getting erased
4269,i couldnt understand a word joe said during the entire time
4270,"I have the walmart app for my kids, I have all my order history which I usually click order again... it shows the total amount you paid for the previous orders, anyway, the same order from when we had trump was almost $250, that same order is $550 so it&#39;s gone up more than 20% with bidenomics that&#39;s all I gotta say about that"
4271,Trump: <b>starts speaking</b> <br><br><br><br><br>Biden: 😨
4272,Biden stole the election
4273,"To quote Hillary Clinton, &quot;What difference at this point does it make?&quot;"
4274,BRAVE MAN TRUMP
4275,DOESN&#39;T MATTER WHAT BIDEN MUMBLES
4276,TRUMP 2024
4277,TRUMP LOVES AMERICA  XX
4278,is biden smoking lean
4279,"This is really selfish of Joe Biden to run for elections. He definitely won’t win, why not take a step back so that a more promising candidate can represent the democrats."
4280,We are by far in worse shape than when Mr .Trump was in office. <br> Biden repeatedly lied during the entire debate. <br> If Biden wins this time it will be obvious that it was by cheating period.
4281,This video needs a fact checker
4282,Biden lies so much.
4283,Idiocracy was a prophecy.
4284,They shouldn’t have let Dana loach around she isn’t like this normally but she knows what she is doing
4285,It&#39;s crazy to see CNN host the roast the Joe biden 😮 and then for him to do impersonations of bush and Christopher Walken
4286,DJ TRUMP IS CRACKED IM THINKING 1000 YEARS
4287,It feels more like a battle between two grandpas than an presidential debate. I hope for all Americans good luck 🇺🇸🦅
4288,After watching Bidin the last 4 years I am inclined to believe that  he was in decline menaly when he was running . He never got out and campaigned he stayed in his basement . I remember thinking back then that I have never seen an election where you never saw a politician running for office out in the public&#39;s eye  as much as Joe was .
4289,America is cooked 😂
4290,Trump evaded the question on immigration. Can someone  remind him please!
4291,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3000"">50:00</a> he ran because him and his wife have been planning on this for decades"
4292,Nice. They are fighting like street fighter just like here in India 😂
4293,😂😂😂 Biden face emoji 😂👈🏻 🤣🤣
4294,And by the way...
4295,Projection is perhaps the most important defense mechanism in politics
4296,What are “black jobs”?
4297,"As a 70-year-old woman he is correct period there were fathers in home they worked hard .Mother&#39;s cooked and cleaned and watched after their children. they helped them with homework if they could. In the worst of times They loved each other and stayed together regardless of Jim-Crow, attacks from KKK and Social norms of that time. Family church community and the future we&#39;re in our spirits and our minds and our hearts.. Then Johnson signed the welfare at knowing that it would cause internal grief and heartache. It was the divorce Of the family by the Liberal government And affected all things about the black community even to now. Add the Margaret Sanger manifesto with abortion clinics., Had the LGBTQ agenda to emmasculate  The black American Man..the Mexican drug cartels and gangs and unchecked illegal guns in the Black communities . Its the racist,liberal elitists,the wealthiest of America and George Soros political hacks and .main stream media . NOW, HERE IS DAMON SAYING EVERY THING I&#39;VE  SAID FOR 6 YEARS AND HAVE BEEN CHASTISED FOR  BY FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND ASSOCIATES FOR MY WHOLE  REPUBLICAN POLITICAL LIFE.

4305,TRUMP 24 - Biden  0

4321,Putting commercials before Trump every single time ... This is a joke n Joey B is embarrassing to listen too 🤦🏻‍♂️ Dont talk about peace treaty dont talk about Trump getting nominated for 2 Nobel Peace prizes... When he starts jumpin around u guys stop him 😂😂😂😂😂
4322,"Wow.. what about white child care, he is pandering to black people because no white people will vote for him."
4323,"Yeah, Biden&#39;s age is a problem. Much worse, though, is that 2/3 of Republican voters still believe they don&#39;t have a legitimately elected president. In 2024, THAT IS the problem with the United States."
4324,"Both of these men have terrible egos. With Trump it&#39;s always &quot;I did this&quot; and &quot;I did that.&quot; And it doesn&#39;t seem to matter to Biden that he may no longer be capable, all he wants is to be President"
4325,Trump: I am the best<br>Biden: I am the best of the worst
4326,Bidens got that gyatt
4327,"Hamas has 5 American hostages, Israel killed 5 British humanitarians. I wouldn’t be surprised if no hostage come back. It’s not like Israel know where their hostages are but they flatten the whole of Gaza?"

4339,Hahahaha
4340,Good luck Trump xx
4341,My favourite part is when Biden says number one as though a second point would follow. And then it never does. At one point he had two number ones in a row 😂

4344,One minute Biden is staring into space and the next minute he is trying to form another sentence.
4345,The amount of molarchy and lies coming out of Bidens mouth is outrageous. Their should be some sort of immediate impeachment laws put in place when the lies get to this degree. Incredible...
4346,"Trump went back to mewing in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=949"">15:49</a>. 👍🏻"

4351,Biden: <br>“Number 1:  the idea” <br>“Number 2: the idea” <br><br>Sums up all his responses.
4352,People be critical thinkers they sounds  like job interviews why? What if the real  leaders /power  behind is what they want us to see.. What if this is to blind us with what&#39;s real happening? Don&#39;t be deceived people time to wake up

4373,"Communist left or logical right, if you try to listen to this debate on medium-low, you will not be able to coherently hear what Joe Biden, the Democrat party&#39;s chosen President, is saying. This says a lot about their party throughout his entire term, a lot."

4375,Men deciding what to do with a woman’s body… 😑
4376,"It&#39;s easy to stay in power, just ask the public what they want and then deliver. It&#39;s not difficult."
4377,Even trump seems to be more concerned for Joe then  Jill and his team. Let that poor man enjoy the rest of his life instead of making him a comedic piece on national tv.
4378,I think we need another person

4506,I love trump&#39;s confidence
4507,Horrible Performance by the Biden Administration!!! Biden`s too old / Dementia
4508,☻️🌍
4509,It would seem Joe has amnesia regarding the THIRTEEN US military members that were blown up in Afghanistan during his disastrous pullout in 2021.
4510,"Had to come back to this today, because heard the Stephanopolis interview a few hours ago — Biden didn’t do himself any favors today. Still sounded weak, confused, angry, even a bit vindictive in mentioning Trump. Totally in denial about what the polls are showing (think WSJ has Trump up by 6 %, well beyond margin-of-error). In that respect, he was almost Trumpian, trying to present “alternative facts” that fly in the face of reality."
4511,For Hawaii 😢here’s $500.00.  “let me tell you something about me” said biden😮 nevertheless heard nothing since..
4512,To say groceries have went up 20% is laughable😂 a lot of stuff I’ve been buying literally has doubled or more since Biden took office…
4513,Trump ain’t answer no questions he just arguing these dudes venting not debating 😂
4514,Please answer the questions for God sake!! We need to know which each party will offer in change for our nation not which President is the worst every question!!
4515,I would rather watch them box it out In the ring
4516,Wes 🖐☻️
4517,In the first debate biden kept saying like a broken record &quot;heres the deal&quot; and now he kept saying &quot;by the way by the way&quot;
4518,Biasa bush tulien ta latihan❤nawi

4526,"I hadn’t watched the full debate till just now. Gotta say I didn’t think Biden did AS bad as everyone is making it out to be. I’m 100% positive he is beyond early stages of dementia or some other cognitive issue but I was expecting far worse. Now that being said, I can only imagine what he’s going to look like in another year or two…<br><br>Trump was basically what I expected. A handful of decent talking points mixed with a mountain of hyperbole."
4527,Biden administration destroying the middle class - now we see why - he&#39;s been absent from his body this whole time
4528,"Because I am proud of the United States of America and United States of Africa remember forgotten.I help Trump in this campaign .Only the new tradition proned by Mandela isnot good.if Joe is 100years old,he can continue to stay in chief of the Un organisation.But I think that my référence Trump is reelly the best choice."

4533,We go with trump...biden is a top failure
4534,Trump is much more cognitive.
4535,I think the real question is who is really running this country? It cannot be Biden  making decisions due to his cognitive issues . <br> I suspect probably his wife.

4570,I already knew to vote for Trump. But now it&#39;s very obvious.<br>Biden just lies about what &#39;they are gonna do&#39; while Trump tells it how it really is.
4571,“There’s motion between us” 💸💎🥶
4572,"Trump is the man we all need, biden has destroyed this great country.... The world needs Trump"
4573,"On the survey Trump was 43 rd out of 45 from worst to best. Joe has problems with communication but the survey claims he&#39;s actually doing something for the country compared to Trump. Yeah right, replace Obamas spot with Trump, Trumps spot with Biden and Biden&#39;s spot with Obama"

4580,Biden  Number 1  Starts of slightly coherently .<br>             Number  2  Starts to forgetting about number 1<br>             Number  3  Starts  to a complete word Salad  🥗 end with a mumbling.
4581,The bills have went up everywhere in the west we need a peace deal in Ukraine 🇺🇦  and Russia 🇷🇺
4582,Biden sounds foreign and looks like a robot.
4583,We paid into Social Security our whole working lives. No immigrant should get a penny of it or Medicare
4584,"I think President Biden shouldn&#39;t have been allowed to engage the debate, a bit of slurred speeches. Isn&#39;t it appropriate for someone to act in his place? Not very easy being an opposition to a prospective and eloquent president like Mr. Trump. I admire the courage of Joe Biden, he stood tall with valid points in my opinion."
4585,Benjamin Netanyahu had warnings I&#39;m sure he knew something it&#39;s pretty obvious that what he is upto
4586,"Julius Malena said it best, you can have a platform to speak and say nothing, that is Mr Joe biden."

4595,"What I’m seeing from Joe Biden so far after watching half of this “debate” is him mirroring Trump in the way he speaks lol… and constantly accusing him of being a liar with no real evidence to support how he’s lying…… so far this is a massive L for him. <br>Donald Trump is coming through with a far better argument even though I’m not siding with either of them because I think they’re both imbeciles in their own special way. <br>RIP America, was it nice knowing you ? No, not really but you were definitely something."
4596,President Trump all the way 2024 🇺🇸 we pray that Byedin doesnt fall victim to Killery and Obumba scary times indeed 😉

4603,This debate makes it clear that the people who are really ruling the world are rubbing our faces in the fact that politics is now a complete joke and democracy is an illusion.
4604,Nobody trusts CNN
4605,They did everything they could to boost Biden and make Trump look bad. Biden still fumbled and bumbled throughout the entire debate...
4606,"SNL doesn’t need to make a parody, the original is Gold enough 🤣"
4607,lol madness.
4608,nothing but lies
4609,CNN is corupt and work with government..they knew of Biden failing.
4610,"Biden is embarrassing and Trump said an impressive amount of lies, great"
4611,Its so obvious that Biden doesmt understand economy
4612,Exactly the same battle that happened in 2020
4613,"Joe Biden is the worst president in the twenty first century. <br><br>Crime has risen, inflation out of control, border&#39;s being overrun, leaving Americans and military equipment behind in Afghanistan, people loosing their jobs over vaccine mandates, Russian and China on the move, increased taxes across the board and many other issues that could have been prevented."
4614,Every time Biden speaks I have to turn on the subtitle 😂

4619,Those two are not fit to president&#39;s 🤦
4620,"Trump said to biden:<br>I don’t know what he said and i don’t think he knows what he said either.<br>America The greatest country in the world have this kind of president for 4decades? Wowww, i respect. Nice good job america."
4621,Who came here to laugh
4622,"President <br>Biden you should quit, you cannot menage this"
4623,No new wars under Trump. Wars around the world under Biden. Indisputable fact. Exact opposite of what the tv told us.
4624,F&#39;s in chat America is cooked lol.
4625,what about the kitchen table?
4626,This is hilarious 🥲
4627,"Biden looks like the white version of Al Sharptongue. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4940"">1:22:20</a>,"
4628,"Wait lol did he just say that in the 4 years he’s been president he’s only created 15,000 new jobs and then a further 800,000 manufacturing jobs 🤦🏼‍♀️🤣 in a country that has a population of roughly 300mil ???? <br>Of course there’s more to be done, you’ve done nothing."
4629,"Someone that is in Joes mental state should not be allowed to be in any type of power, let alone the president of the United States."
4630,Biden should be thrown in prison for life.
4631,Joe has made the U.S. a laughing stock.
4632,I get why people are concerned for Biden&#39;s mental acuity; but I don&#39;t understand either why people see Trump as a strong candidate when he doesn&#39;t speak any more clearly than Biden? Help me understand please.
4633,"I’m not American. I’m your neighbor from up north. This debate is as bad, if not worse, than our politicians up here. Yikes!"
4634,Biden is such a Disgrace to Our Country get Rid of him
4635,The idea that joke biden is on stage debating w/ oldtimers instead of sleeping in a cellar is a bad idea.
4636,"It&#39;s funny they are asking Trump about ending political violence, when he has just been the victim of such on the highest level, as Biden has indicted him just because he is his opponent in this election. Incredible."
4637,The more CNN makes it blatantly obvious that they&#39;re hand holding Biden throughout this whole thing and still bidens falling just adds more support for Trump always remember that
4638,"YUP,YUP,YUP!!!!;Trump IS Right about all of this stuff except abortion, what woman wants there state to make her medicle decisions that should not be anyones bussiness!!

4646,I&#39;m a veteran and I hate Biden
4647,"What president Trump says is just common sense too.. I mean, let’s pretend for a second that the phenomenon of 3rd world nations emptying their prisons into the US isn’t well documented.. it is, but let’s pretend it’s not.. WHY WOULDN’T THEY DO THAT??? Biden told the world we’d let them in with no vetting. Of course they’re going to dump vast quantities of troubled individuals into our once great nation. Leaders in those countries would be crazy not to do that."
4648,"Biden is not in Good health to run, needs to Retire."

4667,doesn&#39;t look like Joe Biden is it really him?
4668,"Prolly the world leaders stayed at other hotel before trump hotel was built in Washington DC, needs to be looked into a little further to find these Dems owned percentages of or was investors in the hotels these leaders stayed in before Trump and this is why they are all riled up and making a big deal out of these world leaders staying in the Trump hotel because they lost money. No doubt."

4684,If I had to choose I would vote trump
4685,Joe “The Idea” Biden
4686,I can see the passion in Trump and how he speaks. His very soul is furious and for a REASON.
4687,Titan is dumping garbage on us in the skies. The snow is not snow. It&#39;s pellets of some kind of plastic. The They create in the storms they create with their mission. They&#39;ve got running. it&#39;s horrible.

4696,"The tax credit that he&#39;s talking about, they took it from the seller, they took. it took it from the amount the seller got. He didn&#39;t pay nothing. They didn&#39;t give nothing. My daughter sold her house. Two new buyers. And they took $11,000 of her money out of her asking price."
4697,If Biden was X-MAN his super power would be: no one could understand him nevermind how long he speaks.
4698,Correct me if im wrong..but did they say there was no audience ...then Biden walked out raising his hand as if there there were an audience...or was that for the viewers...🤔🤔🤔

4722,Nancy didn&#39;t think trump was that dumb to send the crowd
4723,The jar building works trumps if you remember Trump was trying to dig this out and started creating the jobs. All the first stuff that was done when Biden got in was from contracts that Trump did.
4724,Exactly the same immigration situation as the UK. Something is definitely going on. It&#39;s literally identical.
4725,The didn’t even answer the child care question…

We keep the WH  , you keep your jobs and I become the most succesful president this counttry  has ever had !  And thank your lucky stars ! &#39;&#39;"
4728,"If Biden wins again, the election is 100 per cent rigged. Im pretty sure the last one was to be honest."
4729,Joe Biden for President
4730,Is there no better candidate apart from Trump and Biden? It will be much better to engage young-minded youths in politics. 30 -60 years of age.
4731,I felt like Adam Sandler was was going to take the stage and say. &quot; Welcome to another Saturday Night alive!&quot;
4732,"The biggest thing to understand from this is that this is not a Biden issue. It is the entire Democrat party. After all, they are clearly the ones that have been driving this. Entire term into the ground. It&#39;s painfully obvious that biden is not in the driver seat. They are also the ones that have been lying to you about this man&#39;s mental. Fitness. And they are still lying to us. Don&#39;t be stupid enough to think that You can vote for a better democrat."
4733,Does Biden starma?
4734,Obama Bin Biden
4735,"I have never seen an old man that&#39;s so good at lying, why is everybody only talking about October the 7th,why can&#39;t people talk about what led to October the 7th"
4736,Americans help us vote Trump again
4737,On president Biden first election I bet he will win and only a one time president! He should allow another Democrat run with Trump ! Otherwise! Sad😊
4738,"Biden walks out on stage, because of how used to giving speeches in n company of his close yes man circle he walks onto the stage hearing a roaring crowd chanting <br><br> Crowd- “4 more years, 4 more years” <br><br>Biden waves at the moderators and the crowd. The lights stop him from seeing the waves of people that aren’t actually present because he forgot there was no audience. <br><br><br> Biden- “thank you thank YOU”<br><br>As if he was capping off the audience volume. <br><br>If you watch his speeches you’ll notice the same Means of capping off the audience for a quick rebuttal. <br><br>Biden actually said even more but they cut off his mic"
4739,I didn&#39;t like trump that much but I&#39;d rather vote for him than biden that much
4740,"&quot;They&#39;re doing more for veterans than ever before,&quot; Biden says. I&#39;m sorry, but with what staff? The ones you pushed out with vaccine mandates before deciding to not require shots after all? The ones who jumped ship to other hospitals when the VA couldn&#39;t match the pay increases everyone else offered to keep up with the inflation your administration caused? The VA I&#39;m in touch with had to cut back on the total number of beds they could fill because they don&#39;t have enough nurses to tend to a full building. A vet that I knew was unable to get admitted for in-patient hospice because the wait list for a bed was just too long."
4741,"Interest rates are up, inflation is up, and pay and jobs are down. Thanks Biden. <br>Trump 2024💯"

4748,Let’s elect both of them. Maybe they’ll become friends and make peace in United States 🇺🇸 😊
4749,"If I have to hear &quot;we&#39;re in a position where&quot;, or &quot;the idea that&quot; one more time..."
4750,"Joe FYI This country is already bankrupt. Your reckless spending doesn&#39;t help the USA at all. Look at the National Debt Joe and its crazy interest every minute that goes by. I am wondering if you ever took a college course in Economics. But if you did, you forgot all the basics. Yoru idea that Tax and Spend, illegal immigration, your continual 6 working hours a day, and continual vacations tells the American people you just don&#39;t care about us."

4775,Biden lost bcuz hes missing trumps part. Too baaaadd
4776,At this point feeding Joe to Trump is just straight up disrespect to Trump.. ..come on mann ... Give Trump an atleast half Joe&#39;s age person

4784,...
4785,"Being a Swede, I could answer the very first question about the economy easily. None of them answered the question. They started pissing on each other from the 1st second.

4795,Run Biden RUN
4796,Trump did a great job. Kudos
4797,biden is not fit for us president. love for trump from India
4798,Biden ran for president so Trump would not get the job. Not because he is capable. Good to know..

4800,"Trump must be intelligent to be able to focus on what Biden is saying and decipher it without loosing focus.  <br><br>Biden actually is a lot more intelligible than I was expecting, but he still fumbles his words so often that it is difficult to track what he is saying."

4829,"If I was choosing a manager for my small business and these were my best two options, I would shut down."

4857,"America had a black president that was revolutionary,  America had a business man as a president another remarkable history and now currently  are led by ambitious  nd a dreamer but unfortunately old . I believe the country has proven to the world that they give people opportunities and we respect that. But now it&#39;s not time for emotions nd keeping up with records but to get a true leader to lead the country. America is going down slowly due to its weak leadership . They should check african leaders , every african country that has followed that pattern of emotions nd chrrismetic leadership they are donw nd out.. Goodluck America 🇺🇸"
4858,these ppl get on my nerves. let them response to each other before you ask questions. &amp; you keep asking questions like you’re trying to avoid the facts that either of them may be trying to speak. i get that these are important questions but quit asking them back to back like that..
4859,God Bless America
4860,Biden: “We are the most admired country in the world”..”with the finest history in the world..” Oh my God: this is absolutely hilarious. 😂 Joe coming to Earth for one day after living in the space throughout his life 😂😂😂

4866,if Biden will win again! China and Russia will be very happy and other nation will not respect Americans! You have one of the softest President the US ever! no more Biden from the Philippines
4867,Trump won
4868,"Yes his son Hunter ,and Joe can be convicted for  sending and allowing   innocent people who know the truth about your administration"
4869,"Biden made sense but he did not speak with authority, Trump lacked sense &amp; honesty but spoke with authority. I prefer a guy who sometimes makes mistakes &amp; is a little physically unstable but has ethics. Biden has not compulsively tweeted like a child having a tantrum or been moronic enough to suggest injecting bleach, he has acted with the dignity his office. Note Trump sidestepped his position on Ukraine &quot;Russia should keep all land it [invaded] now occupies. He also pivoted on the issue of taxing the rich. Illegal immigration actually rose when Trump was in power, he restricted legal migration which could benefit America; building a wall is pointless when illegal immigrants can use boats to avoid it. If Biden continues he must become more assertive as Americans equate confidence with security. It scares me that America may vote for Trump who has a long history of crime, corruption, deception &amp; scandal &amp; &quot;would like to have the full authority of Putin over America&quot;. It seems that America has not just lost it&#39;s judgement, it has lost it&#39;s reason."
4870,"Yes the Biden Administration has destroyed innocent people and their families  , innocent people had to go to jail under his administration bc we know the truth"

4889,Biden was responding to questions with prepared answers <br>Trump got real time questions from the moderator.
4890,Bring crypto back
4891,"Mostly what I’m hearing is a lot of conjecture and opinion, not a lot of statistics or facts. They’re just playing the blame game. Why do we have to have dinosaurs in office."
4892,"When was the last election in 2020, everyone around, including celebrities, hated Trump, everyone was for Biden, Trump was ready to be torn to pieces in the street, in comments on YouTube videos he was hated, you can find these 2020 videos and read the comments. What happened now, people?"
4893,If you don&#39;t lower the taxes for the rich they would just take their money out of the country and it will destroy the economy

4901,the hilarious show i had ever seen
4902,"its hard not to LOL...Biden looks mortified. Is it crazy to question whether he maybe has been fed a false narrative, by a go between. America really has been run by the same people/countries posting their troops (or just ppl whom where strategically coerced) in America disguised as immigrants. I&#39;m not even pro trump, but Joe DID seek retribution, and what&#39;s sad is it&#39;s not even surprising. I highly doubt the founding fathers included the 4th amendment with the idea it could be circumvented by one mans &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot;. America was built off of freedom, yet ppl isn&#39;t even free to control their own consciousness. This is the country that technically defines addiction as a disease but nonviolent addicts take up much of the prison space costing something to the tune of $80,000 each per year...some sitting 20 year sentences for a drug that is now legal and sold in stores....Im willing to bet a ONE time payment of $80,000 would&#39;ve prevented SO much suffering, ultimately getting passed down for generations if used towards prevention, with mental health resources. The LAST thing we need is to fund prisons and police any further."
4903,Trump 😎<br>Biden 😨
4904,Just take a look at Biden’s face
4905,America is COOKED 😭🙏
4906,As someone in the military....I CANNOT STAND JOE BIDEN..... ZERO respect for joe biden and his crooked people
4907,"I think Donald Trump or Joe Biden shouldn&#39;t be president at all, I think we should have 2 new candidates., Does anyone agree?"
4908,Joe should be charged with treason
4909,Yall js vote for lana del ray instead tbh

The CNN mediator saved him with an assertively stated “thank you” that cut him off in mid-sentence although he still had time left.

I have no idea what is really going on in your country, but I wish you a better leader who will listen and finally hear what YOU guys want and need  inside your country and inside every american family and not what Russia or Ukraine or Afghanistan or anyone else needs or doesn&#39;t need. You got a great country with incredible history and strong people, but it doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have problems inside. But look what these two people are talking about. Putin, Putin, Putin, Zelensky, Russia, Ukraine... and just couple of words about their homeland, about all of you. <br>We are pictured as cold, bloodthirsty haters but that&#39;s not true! We are not that bad. As for me and all people I know we don&#39;t hate anyone, we also want peace in this crazy world and we also want to invite all of you to come and see how we live and to know us better.

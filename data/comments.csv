58,"This was the worst thing to happen to Trump.  Yes Trump did win the battle, but he lost the war.  Biden drops out and then the Democrats quickly unite around Kamala Harris.  The energy is as big as I ever seen it since Obama ran in 2008.  Trump is just flailing around and wants Biden back like a drug because now Harris is leading in a lot of polls.  She&#39;s going into the convention and whatever convention poll bounce she gets is going to be big.  The Harris campaign has a better ground game even though her campaign for presidency started a month ago.  THIS may the turn point in the US election."

71,"As a European its odd to hear debates that is more about trashtalking instead of saying what you want to do with the taxmoney, and show this in figures how you will be able to do this within the budget you have. Its like a freakshow and its not mature in any way shape or form🙏"
72,Trump is like Lincoln <br>Lincoln’s predessor was the worst. Trumps predessor is Biden
73,"Where I live, every one got fired at Tyson so they could hire illegals"

88,"Everything about this event is bizarre. Not just the words coming out of their mouths but the entire setup of the event in general.

94,I&#39;ll tell you something: as a french person seeing that debate from far... I can tell you Trump is actually very kind to Biden. He could have attacked him many times about his cognitive capacity from the very beginning of the debate but the only attacks are about politics. I actually think he&#39;s nice to him.<br><br>This is not even a debate... Trump wins that&#39;s all. As a right wing person I do think the United States does need him at the office. Clearly.

123,Holy shi Joe is gone.... can barely follow what this mouthpiece says.;
124,The idea...
125,"Government Accounts for Nearly 25 Percent of All Job Gains in 2023. The total job gains up to November 2023 was 2.552 million. Government jobs account for 636,000 of them (24.92%). Government-funded jobs are not indicators of growth and certainly not an accomplishment: Quite the opposite! Government positions only exist as the result of wealth transferred from the private sector to the government sector. A staggering 636,000 of these jobs were included to subsidize and obscure the actual job growth numbers."
126,"Trump wishes he still had Biden to pick on. He has no answer for Kamala/Walz. Trump is in trouble right now and he knows it. Hes still bringing up Biden in his rallies, he wants Biden back!"

159,If you write it out and filter out the hesitations it&#39;s not that bad. Talking to a constant liar is kind of hard. Having said that Trump had indeed had a more clear way of talking. He was above his average in appearance and Biden much below.

169,AMAZING
170,I feel like the average American voter went into this debate ready to make a choice finally...<br><br>They wanted Biden to explain how he had let the country fall into such a bad condition and what his actual plans were to repair it<br><br>Or was ready for Trump to expose himself as a liar or a crazy person as they have been told so many times that he is<br><br><br>Then watched the debate and saw it with their own eyes without the media spin<br><br>Trump continue to have lots of ideas to improve the country and examples of how things were better when he was in office..<br><br>And Biden spent the entire time ignoring and denying how bad things have got or just lying and then made very few sensible ideas to improve the country <br><br>Spent nearly every minute he was given trying to paint Trump as the bad guy<br>And of course sounded senile and nonsensical but whats new there <br><br>Any democrat politicians watching lost all remaining faith in Biden from this debate <br><br>Then when the assassination failed the democrats knew they would lose this election so sneaked in a new candidate <br>Trying to trick the public into voting for a black woman <br>Even though she has a record of voting against everything the majority of voters want and added a woke jewish guy as her vice president who&#39;s main priority is gender surgery for young children and tampons in school boys toilets <br><br>I guess the media and government is so convinced they have the public fooled they don&#39;t even have to pretend to have thier citizens interests at heart anymore <br><br>And somehow there is still people who will say Harris will bring a brighter future even though she has voted against all the things she is now claiming to want to support <br><br>World has gone crazy<br>Please Americans save the western world by voting for a strong leader to inspire all the west <br>Not another woke globalists puppet to ruin all our children&#39;s future
171,Vad beträffar abort så tycker jag jag att omständigheterna om kvinnan har blivit våldtagen eller incest mera med mera så är det kvinnan som ska avgöra om hon vill göra abort eller inte inte någon doktor så har jag i Sverige för att jag hade hade fria bort beträffande gränserna så går det inte att ha fria gränser att folk kan komma hur som helst det har vi det är samma Sverige och med flera identiteter så det är en . Sedan var det beträffar gränserna så har Trump rätt det kan inte vara helt uppe för vem som helst att komma in ja som Trump men man får ju ett arv ifrån den gamla regeringen eller presidenten men det gäller ju åt båda håll 07

334,"is this litterally just Ed Hominems like do they actually talk about how they will improve thier country , as a foreigner tho , PURE ENTERTAINMENT"
335,So what I gather from this is that he never cared so much about the people but about proving his nay sayers wrong. Jill “looked” the last and from a PR stand point they wanted to seem like the perfect Irish. Catholic family 😂<br><br>So he was always fake…
336,Biden is a disgrace

350,"America hasn&#39;t grown past it&#39;s distractive racism. We have untold millions and billions being invested into technology such as AI and robot building. There&#39;s nothing wrong with these technologies, but what actually has become a non-common sense issue, is the fact that every penny invested into these machines could&#39;ve been used to heal the problems that haunts America today. Homelessness, low  job hiring, starvation, and a climate that&#39;s unpredictable with a poor ozone layer where UV light will be increasing. Robots and AI will take away jobs usually worked by the lower-class and minorities... Gone. Robots only, no humans allowed. Invest in the America people. Not becoming lazier. What&#39;s great about a country that&#39;s running on all cylinders, because they leftout the core of backbreaking black, brown, red and yellow that not only built America, but made America what it is today... That&#39;s America!"
351,Biden&#39;s in Dreamland and he&#39;s talking in his sleep right now
352,"This is beyond entertaining, wish it came more than a few times every four years."
353,whos gonna pay me reading all your comments...
354,Notice how Biden didn’t say they didn’t cheat but he said “there was no evidence of that” like come on joeyyyy we knoweyyy !!
355,"Biden’s body language shows he’s lying. Rubbing your nose means you’re potentially lying or stressed. I say he’s lying. Check it out around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=105"">1:45</a>"

379,"Just watching this debate. Actually, I don’t think Joe did as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Yes he does look older and more frail than DonOld. But I thought his responses were solid. And I think his stuttering problem was an issue. BUT DonOLD is a liar!! And the lies just roll out his mouth so easily. UM Charlottesville happened. We all saw it. The US is more energy independent under Biden than Trump. The data shows that during Biden’s term the US has exported more energy including petroleum than imported and we have produced more energy than consumed. NATO is not saying hailing the successes of Trump.  It’s very fascinating to watch the lies just roll out of his mouth like it’s the truth."
380,"Trump is the same age now that Biden was when he was elected.  Trump&#39;s frequent, infantile and incoherent rants suggest cognitive impairment.  Let&#39;s not repeat history.  We do not need another octogenarian president!"

To this extent Trump is brilliant because he knows the water will boil the more you turn up the gas pilot."

476,Joe Biden seriously should’ve considered having an interpreter with him 😂
477,One thing is true war was not with  Trump Biden war .
478,It&#39;s funny these President&#39;s say there going to do all these things but forget it all when they become president
479,Biden: 😦😵‍💫🫡 🤤
480,I-it’s just sad to see Biden so down bad mentally. No matter how I feel about his ruling- I still think it’s sad. It’s like seeing an 85 yo work as a fast food worker.
481,"Woman for TRUMP , latinos for TRUMP 2024!!!🇺🇸🫶🏻"
482,"Biden: &quot;Wifagrsgfgscuwsmreasylumofficers.&quot;<br><br>Trump: &quot;I don&#39;t even know what he said, I don&#39;t think he knows what he said either.&quot;<br><br>TRUMP IS SUCH A SAVAGE😂😂😂🇺🇲"
483,Love you president Biden ❤
484,Trump: “Let’s not act like children!”<br>Biden: “You are a child!”<br><br>These two are like 2 2nd graders arguing on the playground😂😂
485,If groceries went up by $20 I don’t think anyone would notice or even care enough to be complaining
486,I used to be a Democrat my whole life until I see how corrupt and dirty and lying they are. I have now turned Republican because I see how good America ran when Donald Trump was in office it ran at the top speed. The best it has ever ran.  So we need donald trump back in office twenty twenty 4 make america great again
487,The republicans got the veterans and the bikers behind them. And the american military
488,Some of these comments about Biden have my ribs hurting 😂😂
489,Should be called democrat crime
490,Did he say asylum?<br>Explain that one..are we building more asylum?
491,America has never ran so strong as when trump was our president
492,"We never had no wars when Trump was in charge. There are all kinds of wars going on. Now that the democrats are in charge, this is b*<b>****</b> Too many innocent lives gone because of the democrats."
493,"Trump is the only one telling the truth in God&#39;s name.<br> I hope all Americans know this because we all are backing Trump, he will.  Be R President.<br>In twenty twenty four I cannot stand the lies. Lies that come out of Biden&#39;s mouth.<br> He is so full of s*** Just like Harris.  Whoever votes for  Harris, don&#39;t give a s*** about America. Trump knows how to run America and he runs it like a business and he is doing d*** good. He&#39;s the best President America has ever had.<br> And thank you, Lord. He will be our President again in 2024."
494,"Trump is the only one telling the truth in God&#39;s name.<br> I hope all Americans know this because we all are backing Trump, he will.  Be R President.<br>In twenty twenty four I cannot stand the lies. Lies that come out of Biden&#39;s mouth.<br> He is so full of s*** Just like Harris.  Whoever votes for  Harris, don&#39;t give a s*** about America."
495,"Why does America just have to choose who’s the least worst? Why can’t they have options where they have to debate who the best of the best is, rather than just trying to figure out who won’t lead them into even more ruin?"
496,"Trump is for America and Trump is for the American people.<br>Trump is the best president America has ever had.<br> And American people, what Trump is our President of America?<br> Post it."
497,Trump is the best President America has ever seen and never had. Trump is the greatest. He is tall America and the American people. So people vote for Donald Trump to save America. We need Trump in the White House.

549,Joe Biden lost his speech his too old to handle the country
550,The idea. The idea. The idea. 🙄 number one. Number two. Number three.
551,Biden just lies everyime he talks! Atleast Obama spoke the truth a couple times.
552,"Love how they read off all the negative things that have happened under Biden and he’s like blah blah best in history and acts like what they say isn’t facts and if he lies enough, people will believe him. Poor old geezer doesn’t even know what’s going on…Jill reads him affirmations for a bedtime story. Kamala pulled the strings, now people wanna act like she’d be different. And Trumps the “biggest threat to democracy” yet they didn’t even allow dems to vote for a nominee, hypocrisy. Whatever side you’re on I feel bad that was taken from the democrats. I mean that’s democracy."
553,"How did you guys let this happen, Americans? Wait …..my country is going down too …time to go to Mars"

568,It annoys me how much old Joe uses &quot;the idea&quot; repeatedly in this debate.
569,take a shot every time biden says “the idea”
570,"You created 1,000’s or millions of jobs?? Which is it?"
571,Good evening 🌃
572,Biden&#39;s speaktime: the age of the universe<br><br>Donald&#39;s speaktime: the time it took for the titan to implode
573,that&#39;s enough to make you sick😅
574,"Biden didn&#39;t increase taxes, he increased everything except taxes."
575,What is it with this dramatic music 😂😂😂 All that is missions is a sped up zoom from space and oversized fireworks
576,Half of the debate of Biden I couldn’t even understand. It seems he was cold while talking!
577,"As a rhetorician, watching Biden here is torture. I couldn&#39;t see the whole debate. So much wrong. Weak voice, slurring speech, sentences not fullfilled, seems confused and kept thinking &quot;he should be in a nursing home&quot;. It is absolutely MAD that he ran for another period. Thank goodness someone got to him and finally realized he needed to pass the torch on"
578,It&#39;s a J.B. mumble fest.🤣
579,whenever joe biden say &quot;the fact of the matter is&quot; (which is one of his favorite lines to say) know that hes ready to tell a lie...
580,❤ Thank you 😊 Namaste ❤
581,&quot;There will be no audience tonight&quot;<br><br>-Biden waves 🖐🏻
582,Why does Biden speak as if he is looking at a screen and looks like a tired person?
583,Roe vs Wade is nothing but legalized murder!!! abortion is murder no matter what trimester the mother is in as soon as conception happens it is a living soul that the Lord has ordained

590,Best comedy show ever 😂
591,"Trump for president he knows what’ he’s doing, he’s been there still regardless that passed four years nonstop keeping up, don’t give Kamala presidency, she only cares about women’s health and winning and I’m a women we need a man in office, that knows everything going on in America not just health care."
592,<b>Biden starts speaking</b><br>Trump: 🤣😀😐😟
593,What in the heck did Biden say I couldn’t stand a single thing or a point he was trying to get across
594,i think all candidates are not good. but the best is trump according to the threat of islam and arabs to every western country including europe and israel.
595,There is no way this isn&#39;t a skit. The way he walks in pointing at nothing looks like he just woke up from a nap. This has to be a south park episode.

605,Please CORRECT &quot;First&#39; because there will not be a second one since Biden withdrew from the November&#39;s elections. <br>Americans could be proud again after 4 years of &quot;bidenism&quot; which brought lots of laughs from people all around the world.

668,Trump will say his thoughts and Biden regurtates like a parrot
669,Biden sounds like a 5 year old trying to have a fight with Trump
670,Trump is not saying (not to allow the womans health to be allowed) with abortion. The victimation of the homeless is worse under Biden especially women and veterans.
671,Biden points at the podium as if to ask “do I stand here?”  His team went over it with him 30 seconds earlier.
672,Democratic party paid for mayhem in our biggest cities in the last year of Trump&#39;s presidency aside from costs of covid. Costs of goods and services are at an all time high under the Biden Administration aside from the covid mandate. The open borders policy doesn&#39;t benefit citizens of this country and only makes us unsafe. We need America first and stop giving money to foreign countries at the same time defending our social services programs.

771,Biden is a complete zombie!
772,"It’s just like watching two kids playing table tennis. Batting who did what and when across the table, with words,  Instead of a table tennis ball.  President Biden looks like he has had a slight stroke. He is actually answering each question and not answering with another question. He isn’t stupid at all. He is physically ILL. They are like two kids trying to gain points against one another. Personally I do think Donald Trump will be good for America!. He does know what he’s talking about. And does have planned strategies. He is an articulate and well educated man. He has to date been the ONLY PRESIDENT that has NOT gone to war!. And like Donald Trump said,  they are like two kids trying to compete against one another.  Which they actually are. Let’s face it,  President Biden isn’t going without a fight. Obviously since this programme was aired President Biden has stepped down. NOT of his own choice, but I believe he knows he is very poorly. And, because of this he should go now with his head held high. It’s NOT a sin to be ILL.  Keep bringing up Donald Trumps indiscretions is childish. He knows as well as we do what he’s done wrong. This maybe and I say maybe,  with caution that he is trying to put things right.  And I do agree with one thing whole heartedly if he should lose it has to be, because he has lost fair and square no funny business like before. You have to admire his tenacity for trying again. He is a strong willed man. Exceptionally intelligent too."
773,Oh let’s see the people who think project 2025 is real
774,I’m so happy at the amount of people I see voting for trump it actually feels like we are going to be alright ❤

What’s going on? It will be over soo trump will be back and all will start to go better. This guy just gives the run around on every question"

789,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=725"">12:05</a> into this video Biden lost the election.

802,"I cant believe these people support Israel, maybe because there a nation of immigrants just like America😅"
803,"Funny how they cut out trumps actual views on abortion, he said republicans want women who&#39;s lives are in danger or have been raped to have abortions, he&#39;s just opposed to abortions at 3rd trimester, rightfully so, are some American states really killing babies AFTER their born🤢🤮🤯"
804,As a Bangladeshi I think Joe Biden is more logical though he was mumbling or stammering in some cases.  Camala Harris chosen for next presidential election is wiser decision as a female candidate in American history !
805,Why they feel like AI ? So not real ?!!!<br>Out of the real world people
806,"Trump loud and clear, good speech good vibe good everything respect him for true"

814,"This Quote suits Trump perfectly: „Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.“- Mark Twain. Trump is polarising the whole world. Look and realise where our world has come to"
815,Abviously President  Biden has not done as well as he should have in the presidential debate. That&#39;s why I fully stand behind his decision to endorse vice President Harris as the new democratic nominee. I Believe she is undoubtedly well- equipped to beat Donald Trump in the coming election 🙏
816,Any indians attendance here👉
817,Poor Biden 😢 He is in the early stages of Dementia. It&#39;s blindingly obvious. I actually really feel for him. He has moments there where he truly looks humiliated and confused.
818,BEST PRESIDENT MY LIFETIME

835,Its a guy that cant stop bullshiting vs a guy that has no idea where he is. <br><br>Ridiculous.
836,😂
837,THE IDEA
838,If they could pull the polls up or they would and show the levels everyone can see for their self in plain writing that Biden is wrong and line listen to The Numbers he&#39;s throwing out and also he thinks that people with believe that these things cause inflation and everything there is one thing that causes inflation and that is government spending so the money they are taken out of the government is causing everything else to go up because they are inflating the price look it up
839,I felt bad with our present and having a cold and probably on the verge of covid at that I really had to throw him off his game with Donald Trump acted like a civil human being. I know it was shocking to me. Just like everything else he just can&#39;t follow through poor Donald. You should pray for his soul
840,"Biden go back in ballot we will elect you,the reason trump economy risen was Covid-19 because there was no movement of people and goods!that made economic growth!if you elect trump this term you’ll see how worse will go 😢!biden did good job"

851,"The political process is no more a fight for rights of the  population,its a multi media marketing strategy,the media has more controll over the populations vote than the political ideology that was firstly there to serve the people and not just the middle class aristocracy 😂who are the aristocracy not the poor or the corporations but the media,justice system, gun laws,pen pushers,problem makers...create the  problem the gov/taxpayer will cover the cost and pay the bills,in house expliotation/corruption......<br><br>Blind beyond what you can see...."

853,I actually feel sorry for Biden. He has a look of confusion and sadness on his face. Hee is far too old and fragile to be up there. Poor guy. I&#39;m glad he stepped down. He left his run too late.
854,"U destroyed our economy so badly people can barely afford basic needs. Then gave all of our tax money to foreign nations instead of helping Americans.  No one is loving it here, no one. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN."

927,"Why did Trump not seize on the opportunity to bring up the Ray Epps saga?  It would have been a slam-dunk. There is no way that you can deny that one. Ray Epps was on video cutting fences and telling (inciting) the crowd that &quot;they MUST breach the Capitol&quot;, yet the FBI absolutely refused to arrest him. Why? The only possible explanation is that Ray Epps is an FBI or CIA asset which means he was planted there to do what he did. When it&#39;s all on video, it&#39;s undeniable, so he should have been among the first to be convicted (he was arrested, but immediately released and taken off of the FBI Most Wanted list), yet there are still people rotting in jail just for being there, but Ray Epps, who was more prominent and actually displayed that he was an ORGANIZER, goes scot-free."

Newsom thought he was clever, but instead, places are closing. You can&#39;t just force companies to pay a lot more out and not expect prices to rise. Under Biden Administration, remember, day one he shut a large company down, sad"

996,"Biden needed to step down years ago. The way Biden has handled everything at every turn...I want a president that I trust to make some good decisions. <br>His pull out of Afghanistan, fun fact..Biden has never once publicly acknowledged that was a tragedy as we lost 13 brave Servicemen and women..he has called it all a success. Not once has Biden written these Gold Star families, not once has he agreed to meet with them, not once has he taken their phone calls. <br>Our fallen servicemen and women deserve to be honored and respected and so do their families. The way Biden has ignored these families, the way he has never admitted fault or accountability for those lost on August 26, 2021 is unacceptable."

1008,The Democrats are real radicals on the abortion law. Trump is very radical with Immigration Law
1009,Trump’s facial expressions are tearing me up. Every mumble that comes out of Biden’s mouth is torture to Trump’s ears.
1010,Yes he stumbled a little bit but nowhere near as much or as bad as these people committing but I do agree with his decision to drop out of the race

1014,"There is, at least, one country in the world who has shown a growth on job offers during pandemics?"
1015,I am extremely concerned about this. Trump is a liar I do not see how he changed from the last time he was in office then had legal problems and still on going and Bien cant remember anything and his speech is a massive problem plus he is up in age so that plays a big factor too.

1169,JOE BIDEN FOREVER. DONALD TRUMP IS NO MORE. Trump will never know what he&#39;s talking about but Biden will always have the power.
1170,Climate control?! Idk but hey clean water.
1171,This is a presidential freestyle battle !
1172,I skibidi with 😢
1173,BIDEN DROPPED OUT LOL
1174,"They don’t want that poisonous, fake, mucus forming food from us lol smh they are crazy"
1175,"Am I the only one who noticed that when it came to speaking on black issues is the only time (so far) that he didn’t have enough to say and was reminded he’s got more time…. That didn’t happen on the other questions, feels like priorities are leaking through…. Doesn’t care about black wages is what it seems like to me!"
1176,why are there kamala commercials over every trump related video? seems like google might be a little liberal
1177,I can’t watch this guy for 2 mins
1178,Biden destroy America
1179,I work for unemployment. This is a lie! There isn’t any jobs!
1180,Thumb will definitely win
1181,"When Biden said “hipuitabitta, hubtaph, whaphabuttapht” I really felt that"
1182,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=721"">12:01</a> Joe Biden sounds like a Zombie😭😭😭😭😭😭"
1183,"Age and time is against joe biden he did the right thing by dropping out of the presidential race, i am watching from Jamaica"
1184,Trump was right 😂
1185,Honestly joe Biden sounds congested but what he is saying is good- i really don’t know why  he was said to be so terrible in this debate
1186,And where did they get grocery only marked up 20 bucks. More like doubled!!!
1187,So two kids on a group project pointing fingers arguing who did what and nothing on real issues/change needing to take place. Grand. We have a lot of brilliant people in this country…. Why are they not running for president….
1188,After that i dont need to whatch any comedian show for at least one week 😂
1189,"I’ll be honest, unless you’re brainwashed into believing blue is the only way I don’t know how you could vote for Harris at this point. Minorities shouldn’t like her for her time working in law…see some of her work in that position. She acts very aggressive and rude, which don’t get me wrong Trump can also be guilty of as well, but it’s at least FUNNY when he does it. She much like Hillary, seemingly hates anyone that doesn’t agree with her and I doubt even many women would want to see her in office as having HER as the first woman president would almost guarantee we wouldn’t have another one given how little confidence she has instilled in the American people as a VP. I thank her for her time working as the VP of our nation, and I’m certain that not all of her efforts have been fruitless but honestly, taking away personal appearances what is there to like about her?"
1190,"Talking about porn 🌟, golf, an sucker and loser in a presidential debate is crazy work😂"
1191,I would rather have an old but wise  Biden to run any country  than a mad man with no manners.
1192,"You could see the difference of Joe Biden&#39;s performance in his presidential debate in 2024 as compared to almost ALL of his previous debates. Most people are not aware about biomedical biometric hacking,nanotechnology, brain machine interfaces, systems of internet of things, weaponization of everything etc. work that could affect the wellbeing of a mass or a targeted individual.  If you are not aware of the nature of these, you are not aware of how fragile and dangerous our world is has become."
1193,joe looks like he&#39;s stuck in a constant ww1 dramatic movie scene
1194,We all know why they added the rule to turn the mic on and off 💀
1195,"I’m disappointed, I really wanted to hear what they were going to say about lowering the daycare costs. I have 3 kids and going to work full time, me alone is not cutting it along with the high inflation rate."
1196,why do they talk like white  people don&#39;t matter or black/hispanics  are belittled?  Citizens are citizens. Why all the race?
1197,"Bidens face when he brings up the fact he called black people &quot;Super Predators&quot; in the 90&#39;s was a look of shock like he had a flashback to when he said it and only just remembered. 🤣<br><br>Sad this is the state of Politics in the US - An old man who must have more helpers than Santa and a Narcissist who can&#39;t accept defeat or be humble for a mistake on any level. IFfyou check the claims of both of the statements they make whether it&#39;s the Economy, Foreign affairs etc they&#39;re both hyperbolic to prop themselves up and punch the other one down, lying to themselves and the public."
1198,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1740"">29:00</a> biden got cooked here too bad the founding fathers aren&#39;t here they would sentence biden for treason"
1199,Wish harambe was on the ballot again
1200,"I’m not even American, and while I definitely was a big fan of Biden in 2020 I do particularly enjoy everyone unified over this debate performance being bad 😅"
1201,On the right a poor old man with a &quot;enthusiastic&quot; wife behind him; Take a look in history at Anna Eleanor Roosevelt.
1202,"he made biden drop out <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a>"
1203,Joe will drop out.
1204,I love US presidential debates even if I dont live there
1205,Trump said he really beat medicare to death😂😂
1206,"Why does everyone act like this is an embarrassment on both sides, Trump is sharp and articulate."
1207,"Seriously, Biden said if the rich pay 25% of their earnings to the gov could get us out of debt within 5 years!?!? Are you kidding me?!?!? Why should the rich pay for the gov messing up!?!? Gtfoh!!!"
1208,Just watching this on July 22 😅 hits different I imagine.
1209,“The idea” 😂
1210,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=949"">15:49</a> well said mr president 👏🏻"
1211,Trump❤❤❤❤
1212,"Biden saying the middle class was devastated by Trump….what a joke! Food and inflation has quadrupled under Biden.  Trump gave people more money take home in their paychecks. The interest rates on the housing market is out of control under Biden. Cars? No one talks about the increase of the price of cars since Biden in office. At first it was the aftermath of Covid bc of production shortages,  but that was 4 years ago. The price of cars is crazy how much they’ve gone up.  Everything more expensive and getting worse."
1213,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1280"">21:20</a>😂😂😂"
1214,"if trump saves the palestinians, I will support him too from now on."
1215,🎉
1216,"Trump:&quot;Who endorsed me for president, but i won&#39;t say that.. but they endorsed me for president&quot; is absolutely crazy 😂"
1217,Comprehensive spech expect.
1218,It’s ridiculous how far I had to scroll to find this after searching for the exact title .
1219,"If Biden win the election, the Great America will sleep, Biden needs to retired, he is so old, looks like he can even talk properly due to his old age. Is there any other young and energetic person to be a President candidate for both of the party, ..huizzzz....If i were an American, i will surely vote for Trump."
1220,Biden is a war criminal who will answer for everything
1221,Biden doesn&#39;t look healthy
1222,"Presidential debates should be fact checked on the spot, by a panel of 3."
1223,"And now this wannabe president dropped out, joe was the worst president in the history of America."
1224,I can not understand how anyone can discredit Mr. Donald Trump. He is the salvation of America!
1225,Everytime Joe Biden says the idea take a shot
1226,Joe mumble
1227,Biden doesn&#39;t even believe his own lies.. BIDEN RUINED AMERICA AND IS A LIAR AS TRUMP STATES...WE&#39;VE SEEN THESE THING COME TO PASS AND BIDEN STILL SAY&#39;S THEY AREN&#39;T TRUE WHAT A FARCE...
1228,My favourite comedy movie:- America 🇺🇸🏳️‍🌈
1229,Bring back Trump
1230,"This is very tough for Biden,  he looks very frustrating"
1231,"To make someone believe, first and foremost, speak clearly! and I don&#39;t think Joe Biden can do it. Thanks to Biden&#39;s speech in the debate, I have another materials for my students to practice English listening for their IELTS test!"
1232,&#39;&#39;and by the way&#39;&#39; ...
1233,who after biden resignation?
1234,The idea that Joe still think he&#39;s good fit for the job is shocking .
1235,Baiden is a fearoooooooo ……..this shows that Trump is already triumphant 🎉🎉🎉
1236,Trump thinking &quot;am I high&quot;?
1237,"Thee IDEAA that we found ourselves in a situation where, number 1☝️, We beat medicare, number 2, You’re the sucker You’re the loser number one…😕😞😞😞😪😴😪😞🙂‍↕️😯…. And by the way 😦"
1238,the question was.... its ridiculous how often thats said
1239,i say i dont believe woman should be in positions of high power because woman can be ridiculously emotional but boy thats all im seeing is emotions overpowering reasoning its crazy lets just keep putting eachother down with terrible insults instead of explaing in front of Americians why they should be the President of America
1240,shoot i dont like biden but at least hes somewhat answering the questions
1241,how are you gonna help americans in the throw of addiction that cant afford it???? its all joes fault its all trumps fault GREAT ANSWER YOU GUYS
1242,sooooo what about childcare????
1243,Leeeeeeeeeets geeeeeeettttt rrrreaaaaaady to <br>MMMMMMMMUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM LE 😂😅<br>😧
1244,they need to stop attacking each other and tell us why they should be the president answer the effin questions
1245,Biden made Trump look like a lot more eloquent than he actually is
1246,Biden whole time: <br>&quot;Hey that guy is cool i might vote for him&quot;
1247,Ok! President Biden is slow in talking but at least he is acknowledging and answering all questions! Trump is dodging all questions and just keeps blaming Biden for everything.  Jake and Dana did hold Trump focused on answering questions.
1248,The face of Donald Trump when Biden is speaking 😂
1249,Southwark gonna have a field day!😂😂😂😂
1250,THE IDEAL!!!!!
1251,Niether one addressed the cost of child care in reality!
1252,Who else is here after Biden dropping out?
1253,Trump doesn’t even know what Climate Change means! He didn’t answer the question!
1254,its like a couple boys fighting no ones answering the actual questions
1255,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=790"">13:10</a> Pro-life ❤ not pro-choice!!! We need Trump back in the White House to Make America Great Again. 𝗝𝗲𝘀𝘂𝘀 𝗟𝗼𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝗺𝗽 ✝️🙏🏾"
1256,"To all Americans, please vote for someone who at least has clear speech. I thought you&#39;re not supposed to come to a debate drunk. Biden, what!?"
1257,Looks like a rap battle between Eminem and Mumble rappers
1258,Trump never takes responsibility for his evil actions.
1259,Biden: we beat medcare Trump Yeah he beat it to death                                                 was funny not gonna lie lol🤣
1260,Trump doesn’t even answer the questions! Why? Because he’s the biggest liar.
1261,"Yes its true. All of our benefits, medication, SSI, housing, etc are all going to illegal immigrants that joe is allowing in with open borders"
1262,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1286"">21:26</a> he said &quot;I&#39;m going to continue to push until we get the full ban, full initiative, relative to what we can do with more border patrol and more asylum officers.&quot;  I dont see why people think this makes him soumd confused.  He&#39;s actually answering the question as asked, unlike Trump who uses every question as an excuse to rant off topic.  Yeah Trump sounds articulate while he&#39;s making stuff up, like saying that Biden opened the borders.  Its easy to find the words when you say whatever the heck sounds good to you.  Biden is carefully thinking of the accurate response and happened to stumble on one word.  In the context of a high pressure timed debate, someone stumbling on a word as they quickly decide which point to make in the moment is normal. I&#39;ll take unembelished honesty over articulate nonsense any day."
1263,Who is here because Joe Biden cancelled his plans for re-election
1264,Joe:... number one.....number two....number threee.......
1265,Biden talks just like Tinubu of Nigeria 🇳🇬<br>Could it be the &#39;B-factor?&#39;<br>Couldn&#39;t wrap my head around what he says
1266,"So according to Biden, only black families struggle with child care and home buying cost😅😅😅"
1267,And the problem isn’t biden. It’s the DNC platform AND the shadow people who are really running the country into the dirt and pulling this puppets strings.
1268,The idea
1269,Biden wasn’t the right guy in 2020. He’s never been the right guy. It was just his turn and they didn’t have anybody else so they stole it for him and installed him against America’s wishes. All you need to do is see his son Hunter to see what JB produced into our society. Father of the Year he’d never win.
1270,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=5065"">1:24:25</a>"
1271,Joe Biden is caudeling the black community for votes
1272,Let&#39;s see 900 billion dollars to Ukraine  from you the tax payers under Biden under Obama trillions to 13 wars more depth more death in history including more than ww1 ww2 combined.under Obama and record breaking inflation under Biden gas food real estate electricity disaster and his clean so called economy which is worst for enviroment than gas this Man just  like Trump said  a disaster

1278,Me tooo😅
1279,TRUMP🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
1280,I saw it for myself President Trump should have won the last election. I cannot imagine how it changed overnight. Where&#39;s the proof that it wasn&#39;t stolen? I don&#39;t see or hear anything about that.
1281,Who’s continuing to watch after Biden dropped?
1282,We need them to play a game of yugioh!
1283,This is what started the whole coup for the dems. They didn’t think he would do this debate. Trump 2024 🇺🇸
1284,"When it’s the turn for Trump and he starts grilling Joe, I look at Joe’s face and he looks very disturbed - I sympathize with him . Grilled Joe is gone !"
1285,"I agree that this is our last chance to change things around for the better. Making the right choice is the most important thing we have to face, right now more than ever!"
1286,"I love how the democrats in this comment section are trying to cope with the dementia patient of a president they &quot;voted in&quot; by acting like both did horrible during this debate and &quot;it&#39;s all a joke&quot;. Trump&#39;s absolutely destroyed Biden no contest, and he just proved on July 13th how much of a leader he truly is."
1287,Imagine if this kind of debate happens in india between former Pm and current Pm ☠️.
1288,Trump is the right guy.
1289,why joe why because we know what you are we know what runs rampant in dc and throughout the media and corps
1290,"This type of debates should be in our country also.<br>but our minister is coward. he is afraid of media conference, then its impossible to imagine that he would debate because he dont have guts to debate.<br>its our fault who is blind."
1291,"Trump should be able to make right what was done to him the way he was treated. I believe there are a lot of people being treated wrongly in the same similar ways. This is the cause for American division. We cannot allow this. There is so much more that is wrong going on and I hear one person talking about solutions and the other totally stuck on trash talking. I realize that this is a part of running for president, but I have never seen such ridiculousness."
1292,i worried biden will collapse in the middle of debate...he look not fit to be a  president and the whole world can watch it😂
1293,"I know about the homeless veterans. I met one. I know that lots of people ended up homeless because it was made possible when rent was so called not required to pay during covid. There was no recovering for them and lots of people went homeless. There&#39;s other things as well. Even now there&#39;s people dying from cancer and they are still trying to work to pay their bills and keep up their rent. A year ago this person owned their home and was doing well. Now that they are sick they spend their life alone sad and worried about getting through. Where&#39;s the help for someone in this place? He has worked in his life. He did his part. There is no program available to help him. At least not close to home, in Wisconsin."
1294,The debate that sunk the Biden campaign.
1295,NOW WE GET KAMALA V TRUMP DEBATE YESSSS🤣💀 Lets go Trump
1296,imagine a world where journalists did their job and people actually took them seriously
1297,"let&#39;s be frank, Biden&#39;s presidency was horrible for the us and the world"
1298,It’s Joever
1299,Everything just went downhill after Biden became a president.
1300,I’ll never forget how Tangerine Man handled Covid what a joke that was!
1301,Twice the cost of living.  TWICE
1302,"Two tacos at Jack n the Box used to be $1. Now it’s $1.99. Inflation has doubled!!  I won’t even get on my increase in car insurance (and I’m considered a senior at 55), and Starbucks. People in California are homeless because you can work at a job making $85,000 a year and still can’t afford rent or purchase a home."
1303,I didn&#39;t receive my tax money from Joe
1304,Yes trust Good job Trump
1305,Bruh biden speaks like a failed robot experiment

1308,I don&#39;t have my tax money
1309,This aged well
1310,"The Biden only one word to describe his performance, INCOMPETENCE 101. The Biden beat Medicaid."
1311,20 million views. Now what. Biden out
1312,“Canis mas macho.”In my Judge Milian voice.😂😂😂
1313,The beginning of the end...😔
1314,"I’m in tears… Biden really doesn’t look well. They should’ve never let him go up there. The man is obviously not 100%. No one on his team noticed what was going on?  I’m 55, and my thoughts are fleeting often, so I can just imagine what Biden is going through. Shame on the democrats!!!"
1315,Destroying our country. We all feel it!
1316,These comments are more entertaining than the greatest comedian. 😂😂😂
1317,"Brandon has no idea what&#39;s going on, surrounded by incompetent liars feeding him a fantasy story he isn&#39;t checking anything, won&#39;t watch news, gets talked to like a baby."
1318,"Biden, God sees you and your Conrad’s. <br>All your corrupt politicians. Keep lying. I pray you ask for forgiveness. Biden, you’re will in trouble. Gods wrath."
1319,He killed biden with this debate 😂 now biden is GONE AND GOOD RIDDANCE

1323,Just fight each other already. !!! 2 old men !!!!! Trump will win
1324,I think Trump is fit for presidency than Joe. American should vote for the right person.
1325,I am watching this debate again after Biden dropped out. I was waiting for a second debate.  Too bad I can&#39;t watch it any longer. No more Trump Vs. Biden debate. Better than any reality show!!!
1326,"I’ve never heard of a politician that I trust, so for me, I go by results - <br>Under Trump, America had a strong economy, was prosperous and not involved in wars, and wokeism was nowhere near as rampant as it is now <br>Under Biden, America has descended into chaos (some states worse than others), we are seeing lawlessness, the economy is crumbling because people are being even more heavily taxed to fund overseas wars, cost of living has gone through the roof, America has become a laughing stock, and woke nonsense is rife <br>The proof is in the pudding……"
1327,Joe says he lost more jobs than gained during his presidency as if covid had nothing to do with that lol.
1328,15k new jobs is not much at all
1329,Joe Blieden is just 🤯. It&#39;s constant. Knock knock mutha fka

1333,"Everyone all around the world not just only think this Biden regime is weak, but all knows that Biden is the weakest ever known president of America in this history of this country"
1334,"Trump is cunning &amp; a smart guy. He turned himself a speaker of  rage, angst, hardship, helplessness, lost hope, lost dreams, hurt and pain of the people and they buy what he says, for it’s what they want to speak out themselves and what they want to hear. As a Christian it brings me to tears in what a mess  your country is and how the people suffer ! Yes ,  he does what none of those in charge „ up there“ have done ; right ? BUT:  The crisis is not ! Centred, nor focused solely on the US … it’s a WORLDWIDE one ; everywhere the exact same, disgraceful story going on.<br> Inflation of :<br>money, crime!, poverty, joblessness, cut offs, price explosions, frustration leading to  disbelief in policies, governments etc. Dearest Americans you are not alone in this! when you isolate from all the rest of us you will get worse problems than you already have. Trump is absolutely right in so many points, but wrong planet. ! It’s not Planet America. I cannot tell I dislike, nor disrespect him; my heart &amp; christian belief  restricts me from doing so  and I understand you the people absolutely… I am not! to judge, nor point fingers, but it needs more than just a good, flaming speech,  moving the masses and emotions. I am not an economist but we all know that economy is connected around the globe, we have a global economy ! Tightly woven together like the Gordian Knot! Every country wants to benefit…. and oh boy ! do we have many countries on this planet ! Ask yourselves What you‘ll do if  on the long run : maga going nada ? Who will you blaim?"
1335,"Somehow, I can only understand better what Trump is speaking"
1336,"when biden goes over time multiple times doesnt get told to stop or thank you besides a few bit ,. but every time trump does and is finishing a VERY important exposing sentance he gets cut off"

1409,Honestly cannot believe Biden got elected. I voted at my local voted center. I&#39;m a black Republican. Had my ticket number And my vote was lost in transit because I live in a swing state. I highly believe voter fraud occured and trump did win the 2020 election and that&#39;s why January 6th even happened in the first place.

1444,Sleepy Joe🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1445,non bias and Biden took the dub.. comments rigged 🥱 ez reads
1446,"Having watched <i>The Debate</i> for the first time, I don&#39;t know what all the fuss is about. Trump gave loads of exaggerations, while Biden gave statistics. Biden spoke like someone with so much more to say, providing the detail of what he had done, the benefits of it, and highlighting the international co-operation of which the USA has been the lead since 1945. While Trump just blamed domestic problems on immigrants coming across the border from prisons and mental institutions, and presumed current international crises could easily be resolved by the respect the World has for him. But Europe mocked Trump privately, as evidenced by the leak of diplomatic cables / reports, while Russia, China and NKorea merely massaged his ego with meetings while taking advantage of his worldly ignorance to continue their objectives. Hey ho!"
1447,"“Yea he’s a 6 handicap, that’s the biggest lie of them all” 😂😂😂.  How can anyone hate this man. Trump 2024"

1465,"Rewatching this affter the assassination attempt...... I notice this time around Trump is sharp. He has laser focus and is NOT shying away from serving up the truth however it comes out.. it&#39;s a passionate tone, a patriotic attitude towards injustice to our nation. <br><br>TRUMP 2024 ALL THE WAY."

1470,Mr Biden your sponsoring a war in Ukraine
1471,Let’s be honest… price gouging is the problem not the economy yall…. “Oh it’s inflation!!” Ummm no there is no data to support this.
1472,At times Trump was almost gracious to Joe. He felt compassion for his sad situation. Joe Biden’s family and close circle should be ASHAMED for parading him around and abusing him like this. <br><br>AMERICA IS CRIPPLED with this bogus administration in charge. Do you know they haven’t had a full Cabinet meeting since October 2023?! His inner circle was trying to shield Biden’s  cabinet to attempt to hide his condition. DOWN WITH THE DIRTY ELITE POLITICIANS! Rise up America!

1474,I&#39;d really love to see Epic Rap Battles of History do a Trump vs. Biden. My inability to understand a word Sleepy Joe says would go right along with my inability to understand rap.
1475,Biden can&#39;t even talk. Take him out of office. Also fire director of secret service
1476,&quot;He&#39;s giving 200 billion dollars on Ukraine.&quot; <br><br>NO WONDER EVERYTHING&#39;S EXPENSIVE
1477,"Biden, much better than CONVICTED CRIMINAL?   Duh"
1478,"Remember when Biden visited a veteran who lost his arm and instead of thanking the soldier he said, &quot;What do you want?&quot; <br><br>Or when he told a construction worker, &quot;I work for myself.&quot; <br><br>VOTE TRUMP 🇺🇸"
1479,The idea!!!
1480,I&#39;m just wondering what people outside of America think of this 💀

1489,"And, by the way. .. the idea that.. and the other thing is ..."
1490,"Trump is begging for money from his followers, yet he can&#39;t pay his own bills. <br><br>Trump will lose.  There&#39;s no way Americans will elect this guy."
1491,"Biden just need retirement, USA is too huge for him to handle"

1494,Millions of people ! Millions!! And we only got 2 senior citizen nominees???<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂
1495,"If trump doesnt win, im going back to mexico"
1496,Biden ended pipeline jobs the first day wheres the solar panels Joe? We want the billions of dolars back from the semiconductor plant. Wheres the semiconductors ?<br>Paul pelosi may have that money since he invested in it secretly or how bout the money from the immigrant hotels nevermind just kidding if the media says it believe it
1497,If i hear one more time an answer starting with &quot;The idea...&quot; idk what ill do..
1498,Biden if you don’t think we have the greatest economy. Step down and sit down. Biden’s only priority is illegal immigrants
1499,I wish Biden wore a voice changer box or Darth Vader mask when he talked. Like nails on a chalkboard listening to him.
1500,Number 1 number 2 what a liar
1501,Watching instead of a thriller on Netflix. Do not regret it.
1502,"Dear Mr Josef Biden: Mr Putin says in his interview that Mr Putin prefers Josef Biden as the president of USA. But Russia is not meddling the US elections. What we had with Mr Hodorkovsky?  I remind you that USA supported a billioner Mr Hodorkovsky who was a citizen of Russia. USA wanted him to become a President of Russia. What we have now? USA supported  Mr Navalny who insulted Mr Putin saying that Mr Putin is a robber and murderer. USA blamed a death of Mr Navalny on Mr Putin. What we have now? An attempt to assassinate Mr Robert Fico of Slovakia and later an attempt to assassinate Mr Trump. Why Mr Biden is so afraid of opposition? And who is really a murderer? Nevertheless, personally, I respect for you as a father who, despite all mass media shows about your son Hunter, remains proud of your son Hunter. You are excellent father! But my former Boss Boris brought up his excellent daughter who will never be Maria Magdalena. And what we have now? Zelensky has become  Maria Magdalena, Navalny became  Maria Magdalena . Who is the next to become Maria Magdalena?"
1503,Any candidates who dodged a question. Did so by use of posponments. Did so to get something ready for later.  Then grinned. But did so really expressivly. Then decided and did return to what he wanted to be focused on (hearing himself say that hey wanted). If they did all of that without any visible help on all or most questions. Both lose the debate. But we all lose out on honesty from both on this televised event and tax payors will help them do their stuff too.
1504,It&#39;s incredible that Biden is only 3 years older than Trump.
1505,I love these comments
1506,"&quot;The only existenital threat to humanity, is climate change&quot; Has biden lost the plot completely? It is clearly nuclear arms and war. Sheesh. Wasting all this money on high cost low benefit climate policies, it is unintelligent."

1596,As a canadian might I ask where was the talk on what is going to be added or changed if they are elected? It seems like all they did was just go back and forth accusing them of failing and being the worst

1610,"They’re both as bad as each other, Trump lies through his teeth and speaks confidently<br>Biden speaks truth but can’t get a solid word out and sounds like he’s on deaths door."
1611,America and Biden seems to forget that back when Trump won he declared he would not be taking the salary to be president because he’s already rich and that he didn’t feel right having taxpayers pay his salary. So he did not get paid for his presidency. <br><br>And the fact he said he wants clean water I can get behind that I just wish for once a president would talk about how they will help our wildlife and our animals of the country/world. Tougher laws tougher penalties for animal abuse over breeding  etc etc and for invading in wildlife spaces.
1612,The Idea! The Idea! The Idea! The Idea! I know almost nothing about United States politics because im from Argentina and my english vocabulary is not extensive but I found the repetition of the starting phrase: &quot;The Idea&quot; kind of annoying so to speak. Can someone give a dictionary to Biden please so he can start his phrases with something else rather than saying The Idea for the tenth time?<br>Also I dont understand what Biden finds funny about anything in a country&#39;s adminsitration. He keeps laughing everytime Trump says something about him he laughs. Why is he laughing? Are politics funny?
1613,"American politics is so weird, what’s with the fkn battle music when they walked in"

1630,Donald Trump a president then he&#39;s going to try to come back into the run Trump will be president next year next time
1631,"Biden is misinformed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=5257"">1:27:37</a> ! This is another reason why I think he shows signs of dementia, its no way he can possibly think it Trump will be easy to beat  coming election,its just the opposite! Biden seem to be in orbit and were on earth! Biden seem to be struggling  to stay focus! No way he can think after this debate ,he&#39;ll win ! Even before the debate, he was loosing, now he has lost!"
1632,The difference between 2020 Biden and 2024 Biden… shocking. That is a massive decline.
1633,"I seen a old lady in the grocery store she said the prices are so high since Biden  became president and opened up the border! She only  getting  $23.00. In snap food allowance, and when Trump was president she was getting $293.00 ,she also said she has a special diet being a diabetic,it Cost more to eat, and can&#39;t afford to buy a new fan even, It broke my heart! I went and got her 2fans! Biden is a liar and made it harder for blacks and Latinos too ,who is definitely voting for Trump2024. I dare you Biden taking away from our elderly, and giving undocumented illegal migrants and allows the undocumented illegal migrants to live better even than our American elderlies,and being proud of it! Word get around ,guess what Biden your not our choice the most of us blacks and Latinos are voting for TRUMP 2024."

1710,"It’s clear as day who still has more professionalism, class, and a brain in his head, even though he’s very old and sluggish now. Trump makes a broad statement, says it’s a fact and idiots agree"
1711,I actually can’t believe the US is an actual country😭

1717,Biden speaks like when I started to 😮sleep.
1718,"i was doing good with medicaid and medicare until Biden came in. I ended up now having to pay for my medicare like I said before. i bought a home when I was working. When I became disabled my my house payment was still $780, My Disability is $865 and they started taking $175 out of my check for Medicare part B.  So do I keep my house or my Medical insurance through Medicare....Hmmm. Let me think!!!!"
1719,Immigration is a problem there is a spot which is what used to be cps building is now housing hundreds of new immigrants every 2 weeks they getting sent all over the country and in the day time there on the streets infront of the stores restaurant asking for money ans clothes its sad what biden is doing to this country and its true what trump is saying there all getting socials with benefits ridiculous
1720,Uh..no offense but white families are suffering also.  😢😢😢
1721,OMG this level of arguments are just embarrassing 😂
1722,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2795"">46:35</a>"
1723,Speaking of SOcial Security. My house payment is $780 and I only get $865 on Disability and was denied my widows benefits because I didn&#39;t become disabled until 7 months past the statute of limitations for receiving widows benefits. I fought for 6 1/2 yrs before that just to get my disability. That is the short story.
1724,Biden just looks like he has a &quot;michael meyers&quot; mask on everytime he looks at trump like 😦
1725,没有神的时代选谁都一样
1726,When i heard 1000 trillianares😂
1727,"ive got to say this i feel like a lot of gen z got swayed away from trump bc of the social issues and propaganda. I myself was a lot more left than i am now but i say i am more independent. But now i am able to see. Yes i believe in equal rights but not at the cost of our economy and civilization. And a lot of the social issues on the lefts go to the extremes. Like no one is going to take gay marriage away and i don&#39;t believe they are like taking away surgeries and duch from trans people. But the far left wants to let children get gender reassignment surgeries and allow for people to get abortions full term while trump saying the states get to vote on it which is thf people getting to vote and get there say on it. He also conpletely opened the border while people can just come into the country by completely thr immigration process and having a background check. thats my example of them going to the extremes. We can all live together in peace together but biden prase on these issues and it at one point got an emotional reaction out of people. But more people are starting to understand that he is even too far left for the leftists. Im not far left or far right. But trump is not taking rights away he obviously gave the choice to the people which has always been. Biden has failed this country. He is in his little pampered bubble and doesn&#39;t see how it is. My family can barely afford groceries at some points but cant get on social security or food stamps while illegal immigrants can. More of my friends and family are either liw income or lower middle class and we are struggling really bad and can barely afford to eat. I am young and not sure if im still able to register to vote bc i turn 18 three days before the election but if you&#39;re in the your in the younger generation like me and are feeling unsure or stuck in the middle please listen to the points i just made. Trump can all around fix our economy. Please vote. If not trump then robert kennedy jr who wouldve be my first choice. His points are really good he talks about real issues in health care, economy, mental health, ect. Im scared that ww3 is going to come quickly if biden gets relected and my brothers, cousins, and bf are going to be drafted maybe even myself since there is talk about women being drafted as well. Im not the most effective communicator but i hope i got my point accross to even one person."
1728,Even with the first question I&#39;m at 5 minutes and 37 seconds. It really does appear that there was a bias where Joe Biden may have been given the questions because his answers sound a lot more prepared and scripted.
1729,I dont understand this biden guy who is he
1730,They both bypassed the child care issue 😂🙄🙄
1731,PERIOD 😒
1732,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1342"">22:22</a> he&#39;s lookin around like &quot;y-y-y&#39;all hear this..?&quot;"
1733,this is what i imagine when bitlife gives you the &quot;be downright nasty to him&quot; option in a campaign.
1734,I’d love to be president one day
1735,I also have a Sagittarius moon sign like trump. The moon sign controls your feelings so I know how he feels
1736,Haha there’s no friendship here and it’s not cool with me they are the leaders of the world and can’t get along. Hello guys? Joey donny we gotta get along first we can’t do anything without squashing this beef.
1737,Rfk jr !!!!!
1738,Donald Trump is the realest of all presidents that&#39;s why they trying to take him out he fixed everything they don&#39;t want it fixed they want us to struggle and make all us stay living check to check

1756,Joe is gonna look wild in 4 years. I hope he can still have a conversation with someone.
1757,How are they allowed to run being in their 80s?  Holy Moly....
1758,"I&#39;m so tired of the Charlottesville stuff. Trump was talking about both people that wanted statues torn down and people who didn&#39;t when he said &quot;fine people on both sides.&quot; He continued and said, &quot;And I&#39;m not talking about white supremacists and neo Nazis, I condemn them totally.&quot;  But the media, including CNN, didn&#39;t want to air that part and spun it into something else to make more people hate Trump. You can look up the full clip."

1796,Biden dating baby sitter
1797,"Strong, loyal presidents of the homeland no longer exist. Most of today’s leaders, led by President Joe Biden, are concerned with winning the White House, even if the price is very high and at the expense of the values ​​and principles approved by the Founding Fathers. Unfortunately, America has reached the top of the curve and is accelerating towards collapse. The main reason is the current leaders’ sacrifice of authentic American principles and values. They are desperate to appease homosexuals, and this is a violation of normal human nature. As an Arab Muslim, I do not want the United States to collapse. Moral failure and doing what the people of Lot did would anger God. Although America stands with the oppressors, it remains an important and pivotal country that contributes to achieving the global struggle and achieving relative stability for the world.<br>God said:<br>Were it not for Allah’s repelling people, some by means of others, the earth would have gone to ruin. But Allah is gracious towards humanity.<br><br>And God Almighty said:<br><br> Were it not for Allah’s repelling people, some by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, where Allah’s Name is commemorated much, would have been demolished. Allah supports those who stand up for Him. Allah is Strong, Honorable."

1806,"In 1988 biden failed at run for president plagiarism stealing from other great leaders speeches same words well he&#39;s still doing it today albeit with the help of teleprompters he&#39;s known for telling lies ,pulling the Wool over of the American peoples eyes ,now joe your exposed for what you always have been"

1816,As a Foreigner: GO TRUMP SAVE AMERICA FIGHT AND DONT YOU EVER GIVE UP!
1817,Love how Trump said Biden doesn’t want it to be this way but he just doesn’t know. I’ve never felt like Biden had a grasp on any real issues. Even back when he was VP all he spouted was nonsense and buzz phrases. I can actually follow and understand what Trump says.

1864,"Take a look back at the 2020 debate. Biden is slightly wobbly but a lot, lot better than he was in 2024. In 2020 Trump at least tried to discuss policy but was just as belligerent as in 2024."

1869,Us Veterans are worse off actually... Thanks Biden...
1870,I&#39;ve been flicking back and forth between this debate and the first presidential debate of the 2020 election. Biden is a shadow of his former self.
1871,Here&#39;s the deal 😂😂😂
1872,"I work intermodal under trump and Biden presidency . I can tell you for a fact American was great under trump . The rail road was moving product across the country the international business was booming the economy was beautiful Americans could live comfortably !!! As soon as Biden went to office, I struggled to live working for the rail road and the product I used to move cut in half I struggle to live for 4 year working intermodal because of Biden !!! Fjb"
1873,"Biden: Walks out, points to the spot, reminds himself of where he&#39;s going to."
1874,Im suposed to vote for these 2? I dont have any other options??? This country cant be divided by 2 people... thats not possible US citizens are either all for one or all for the other... why do we only have 2 options? Where im from we have like 10 and they all come close in the results. Not 49% biden 47% trump and 3% for the other 8 candidates....
1875,"The debate starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=163"">2:43</a> :)"
1876,Trump 2024
1877,Donald Duck is the biggest con man ever lol. Anything negative about him he just dismissed it as fake news.
1878,Ughhhh...  I dunno man this was a mess on both sides.  I get what everyone is memeing about Biden clearly is showing his age.  If you compare this to him in 2008 the difference is shocking but Trump also couldn&#39;t stay on topic to save his life.  I mean I swear rather than answering his questions over half the time he was pointing a metaphorical finger a Biden.  I just want to see questions Actually answered and not some finger pointing clown show.  This is an embarrassing display from what is supposed to be the 2 best candidates to lead the free world...   I&#39;ve lived under both of their presidency and as far as I&#39;m concerned things have gotten nothing but more difficult for me and the people who live around me over the last 8 years.
1879,As far as medical insurance goes Biden is full of it. My 20% deductible for my meds is more than my SSI check all together so now I&#39;m living in borrowed time.

I will like a better life than what we’re living now.    😅cannot even eat out because the prices are so high and forget about  buying any thing else.  I’ll vote for Trump 💯 percent.   Biden is so bad and i don’t want Kamela Harris  to be a president.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>pay"

1972,The only liar here is trump😂
1973,FJB!  Go to an old folks home buddy.
1974,trump just says the same thing over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and again
1975,Extremely boring and infantile debate.
1976,Both suck but trumps better
1977,I got a pay raise before covid to stay with my job it was only $3.50 raise per hour but everything in the store went up 2 - 5 dollars per item so basically the hard work I put in to get a raise is completely gone. I honestly haven&#39;t struggled with bills ever up until the past few years. I thought covid was over for the most part why are we paying these insane prices multiple years later and its only getting worse every time I go to the store the same item that was $4.69 is now $5.29  just a month later and it keeps creeping up every 1 - 3 months I&#39;m not paying $7  for a bag of doritos anymore I like them but come on.
1978,TRUMP 2024 may god bless America
1979,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1167"">19:27</a> period period."

1983,Tremendous
1984,"Using Biden&#39;s own words, words he used in every comment.  &quot;The Idea&quot; that he could be re-elected is frightening."
1985,trump cooked
1986,How Biden be a prisedent? I&#39;m try to imagination all people vote to him to be that one💀
1987,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1294"">21:34</a> Biden really tried his best to not cry"
1988,"It&#39;s funny how he compares himself to FDR and says he&#39;s done more than any other president in a while.  <br><br>People loved FDR , he lead his country through  the greatest war in history.  He got the US out of the great depression. The ego on Biden is tremendous.  Not to mention, no one questioned FDR cognitive abilities, and he he had the support of his party."
1989,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1292"">21:32</a> that&#39;s why you came for"

1991,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1915"">31:55</a> <br>Biden: 😦"
1992,Biden speaks like winston cherchil
1993,The part where sleepy joe is mumbling his words and Trump responds with I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence and I don’t think he knows what he said either about killed me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1994,Trump: Spitting facts...<br>Biden: Its a lie 😯
1995,"Okay, after watching 80% of the debate, I have to be honest. Biden isn&#39;t the same like the last debate, it&#39;s like he&#39;s a different man. I know he&#39;s grown older but my God that man can&#39;t be able to lead America. May the best man for the Americans win though"
1996,"Bro the look on biden face <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1010"">16:50</a>"
1997,Why does Biden always look so lost and confused when he not talking?!
1998,How did Biden convince the &quot;Great&quot; americans to be the 46th.... the fella is just whispering... is he unwell?
1999,Where is kennedy?
2000,Biden really is a good person TikTok and such platforms have brainwashed y’all to think trump is good
2001,"Well I don’t keep up with politics much, but I know one fact that’s true. Me and my family were a whole lot better off in the 4 years trump was president than these last four years. It’s a shame COVID happened toward the end of trumps time, bc it seems like everything Covid caused, they’re trying to use as an excuse for everything going bad like it’s bc of trump and not Covid. Idk all the facts, but I know my situation and that of everyone I know was better off before Biden."
2002,Social media has trump washed these ppl
2003,Trump would spend more time talking s*it abt Biden then him answering the question 😂
2004,Trump once said hitler had good ideas this man is crazy
2005,This debate is based on social media ppl make biden look bad when he actually says some truthful things
2006,Why USA&#39;s elections interest me even more than my own country&#39;s ones?
2007,Two old granny fighting  for coconut 🥥. One got milk out and one went to  doctor
2008,We finally BEAT Medicare!
2009,I never had COVID
2010,It is jover
2011,Trump: 🗿<br>Biden: 😧
2012,You can see even the news anchor were having a hard time keeping a straight face
2013,"You MUST APOLOGIZE TO TRUMP, biden... YOU are THE LIAR! (who doesn&#39;t blink) Is this the new AI rollout? I cannot NOT BLINK with biden - it was unbelievable - TRY TO NOT blink!"
2014,Trump responds to Bidens more than he answers the questions put to him...
2015,"Trump is crisp and clear, but he talks only about himself. Biden is like a sleepwalker or a robot when he is talking about important things, as if he is talking about someone else and is not convincing. Is this the world&#39;s leading U.S. presidential election debate? I have nothing but disillusionment."
2016,Where tf am I??- bidens thoughts
2017,"Okay but that is the issue. We have to worry about our country, for example your family is falling apart but you step out to help another family falling apart which we had no involvement in. Saddest part our generation is fixing it when it’s NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY, we didn’t sign up for this. Therefore it’s not fair for us, we can’t even afford a living without having 3 jobs and 10x more stress. So yes we’re going stand up for our rights too."

2046,TRUMP GOT THIS 🇺🇸🇺🇸
2047,"Jo seems like AI, for sure 🗿"
2048,Biden seriously listed Trump&#39;s $2TRILLION tax cut as a <b><i>NEGATIVE</i></b> for America.<br>Couldn&#39;t even imagine how embarrassing it must feel to wake up knowing you voted for that guy.
2049,funniest bit is when they ask trump a question and he goes straight for biden the whole minute 😂😂 bro forgot about the question
2050,Trump seems more woke and seems to know exactly what he&#39;s talking about but Biden just seems like a puppet
2051,"Trump&#39;s like a broken record; you already know what he&#39;s gonna say: we had the greatest everything when I was president. There were no problems whatsoever except for China, Mexico, Afghanistan, but we were so strong."
2052,Biden 🤡
2053,Are those 2 pensionados the best US have to offer?
2054,Get it right… A basket of groceries that costed $100 costs $200 now. Gas was $2 a gallon and now it’s $5 a gallon….
2055,None of them make sense this country everyone is an immigrant the real Americans who should run for the presidency are red indians it’s time to give them back their country
2056,"Grandpa Biden cant even talk well. All jokes aside, he really needs to retire now."
2057,So this technically is a blame game huh.

2063,FJB! Makes me sick.
2064,I see fear in Biden&#39;s eyes whenever Trump speaks...
2065,Awesome Debate!

2067,Biden is so dumb he doesnt even notice that belarus is allies with Russia...
2068,What blows my mind is that the press had the authority to tell the &quot;most powerful people in the world&quot; when to talk/shut up. Wow!!! Now you know who owns the world we live in...
2069,God please let Trump win! We need a change. People need God!🙏🏽

2098,It is undeniable in every corner of the internet the overwhelming support for trump (97%+) very few of you Biden supporters. I read through every single one of the thousands of comments and there are very very few of you.
2099,Anyone else see Joe Biden eyes shifting and moving or I’m tweaking ?
2100,This Trump guy might make a good President
2101,"i dont support trump, but biden just cannot be president"
2102,"Trumb is my man..witty lovable funny guy, who can lift america..its a last chance.."

2108,They both are here human ..but Biden tried and now we need more strength and the economy has to go up something has to start going right it&#39;s not easy to run a whole country. I feel everyone had a chance
2109,Whats the age of retirement again?
2110,&#39;Biden migrant crime😂&#39;that was literally so true
2111,"*Some youtubers say Americans are in touch with Aliens. <br>After watching Biden today, i believe it. He speaks alien language.*"
2112,Who&#39;s fact checking all these claims? Or is it okay to just throw around these claims to look good?
2113,PERHAPS..BIDEN SHOULD TAKE À COMPLETE REST..I CAN NO MORE HEAR CLEARLY WHAT HE IS SAYING..HÉ LOOKS VERY XHAUSTED BEING THE ÚS PRES..POOR AMERICA HVING THAT WEAK PRES...
2114,"&quot;They call it migrant crime, I call it Biden migrant crime&quot;.. this cracked me up"
2115,As an European im literally shocked. Seeing this debate was a quite weird experience. You can clearly tell which of these men is talking honestly and which one has (tried to) memorise the text he was supposed to say. What a distopian world we live in today..
2116,This is something else. That is such a comedy but at the same time a horror movie because how can they choose out of 300 mil people ppl like that for free world leaders.
2117,Trump is hilarious 😂 trump 2024!
2118,Its so funny 🤣🤣 I feel like this is not a debate I guess a comedy 😂😂
2119,Notice bidens face looks like a mask to be honest

2122,lol
2123,Is Biden suffering from Amnesia?
2124,You 1st said as president.  That you were from Ohio.
2125,this could be straight out of south park!
2126,i genuinely believe this video has given someone a stroke by just watching it
2127,Biden just saying anything he can think of 😂😂
2128,This 1.3 hrs is a waste of time and air space. Clearly they have no plan for the increase of day care because they couldn’t answer the question. They’re children
2129,I still don’t get how Biden became President
2130,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1141"">19:01</a>"
2131,lol “and then he comes in and now we’re all laughed at like a bunch of stupid people”<br>lol it is true America is a laughing stock
2132,My message to Trump is &quot; you are the best US president ever and you are winning again&quot;... More love all the way from zambia
2133,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3848"">1:04:08</a>"

2136,Donald Trump is for better than Jo Biden for the development of the people of USA
2137,Stand up comedy these days 😂😅
2138,why are they not answering the questions??? they’re just arguing. this is shameful
2139,Who&#39;s lying here?
2140,I feel bad for Biden poor guy can barely put a sentence together. I wonder if he still has any reading/writing comprehension skills left? Just that thought alone should ensure that Trump is just logically elected. Peacefully and patriotically.
2141,what is their policy on the aging population and retirement age?
2142,Never forget ashli babbitt
2143,U both need to step aside for real talent
2144,"No one respect USA, u started it trump"
2145,Thank god I’m 10000 klm away
2146,"Two derelicts, seriously is that all 350m population has to offer. My god"
2147,id have Biden in any state over Trump
2148,"Did anyone ask Biden if he even wanted to be president?! Because I&#39;m feeling like he doesn&#39;t want to be and factually, shouldn&#39;t be. Let the old man rest. He seems tired. And I mean that with a warm heart. Look at the dude, he isn&#39;t doing well and can barely stand and speak. Idk who&#39;s idea it was to let him try n be our next president again ... But I&#39;m assuming those ppl who do, haven&#39;t seen Biden speak at all. How can he run an entire country?!? Insane to me. We were so much better off when trump was in office, the proof is in the numbers."
2149,Fjb
2150,The &quot;I don think he knows what he said either&quot; comment will go down w Reagan&#39;s age joke and Obama&#39;s line about bayonets as the best Presidential debate comments since the advent of televised debates
2151,Why is trump center all his points on border control alone.....here in Europe they have no physical border. <br>Make more concrete points everything shouldn&#39;t be about border alone. I think Biden should step aside for more energetic younger person to contest with Trump. <br><br>American is gradually playing politics like Africa.<br>Biden just mentioned something that struck me his son served in the military in Iraq can trump tell us what his children have done to serve America???<br><br>Not about taking tax payers alone and turn around to abuse them because you&#39;re in charge of the highest office. American people would decide who they want as their president.
2152,"Man, I’m freaking crying. We love you, President Donald Trump. God bless you, man Jesus Christ protect Donald Trump. Please protect him. We need President Donald Trump in the White House please we love President Donald Trump. He’s the best president we ever had. Amen."
2153,Biden is senile
2154,The United States is weak under biden!!
2155,"Yes he may have had a large national debt, BUT covid broke out during trumps administration!!! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#trump2024</a>"
2156,Trump is NOT the only one who thinks our country was GREAT again under his administration!!
2157,We have the most successful economy in the World😢 that&#39;s a lie!
2158,THE IDEA that biden claims trump is the worst president is pure comedy
2159,"Many people assume the Democratic Party champions civil rights, but history tells a different story. Since its inception in 1829, the Democratic Party has a troubling legacy of opposing major civil rights advancements. It defended slavery, instigated the Civil War, and resisted Reconstruction efforts. The party founded the Ku Klux Klan, enforced segregation, and obstructed civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s.<br><br>Conversely, the Republican Party emerged in 1854 as an anti-slavery movement. Its founding mission aimed to halt slavery&#39;s expansion and eventually abolish it. This stance faced setbacks, notably the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford case where Democratic-appointed justices ruled against citizenship for slaves. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, led the nation through the Civil War and emancipated the slaves.<br><br>Following Lincoln&#39;s assassination by a Democrat, Andrew Johnson—a Democrat—opposed Lincoln&#39;s plans for integrating freed slaves into society. Democrats continued to resist constitutional amendments abolishing slavery and granting citizenship and voting rights to blacks, amendments passed with overwhelming Republican support.<br><br>During Reconstruction, Republicans secured rights for freed slaves, electing numerous black representatives to Congress. However, Democratic resurgence after Reconstruction reintroduced racial oppression through laws like black codes, poll taxes, and literacy tests, enforced through terror tactics by groups like the Ku Klux Klan.<br><br>Even President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, supported segregation and promoted racist propaganda. Decades later, significant Democratic opposition stalled the Civil Rights Act of 1964, while Republicans overwhelmingly supported it, overcoming Democratic filibusters.<br><br>Despite historical injustices, Democrats shifted strategy, seeking black voter allegiance through government assistance programs. Yet, these policies have often perpetuated dependency and harmed black communities, weakening families, limiting educational opportunities, and undermining public safety.<br><br>In assessing the parties&#39; roles in advancing racial equality and civil rights, understanding this complex history is crucial. It challenges the narrative of Democratic leadership in civil rights, revealing a legacy marked by resistance and failed policies that have impacted black Americans profoundly.—Carol Swain"

2283,I’m with the beautiful orange guy.
2284,You chose a Pareto
2285,I think the reasonBiden’s never heard so much malarkey in his life is because he doesn’t listen and he doesn’t see reality- he is so narcissistic he believes if he says it- then so it is. It’s ignorant and dangerous.

2449,"It is better for Trump not to show himself in open spaces, since he is against the war, and since Biden knows no boundaries. Otherwise, Kennedy already somehow wanted to nationalize the US federal system, also went against powerful elites, and Kennedy was killed by a sniper shot. It is always necessary to look at who benefits, and not the official versions of the corrupt US special services like a madman shot"

2475,"A home is made of parents and children. The behavior of a child such as expressions, gestures, tone of voice and way of thinking is influenced by repeated experience that an individual would adapt if there is comfort. If there is hardship, the individual will learn to oppose the reason for hardship becuase an individual would not want others to feel the same way. It is a child&#39;s natural behavior to not share an experience that hurts because fear existed first than any other feeling. Before a baby cry, fear from spanking is the first. Before a child feels happines, fear of losing a child&#39;s parents goes first. Before an adult feels anger, he&#39;s been literate enough to see conflicts in a global level. Happiness, only child who grew up with their parents feels it. Do you remember getting lost not knowing where your parents went when all along they were holding you with their hands inside a mall? Isn&#39;t it total happiness to know they didn&#39;t lose you and you didn&#39;t get to be picked by a stranger."
2476,"I hope Amerikan people find president like Kennedy young, full power and energy. You need it today. I dont know Trump, but remember what happen in Capitol. Ugh."

I only feel it is life when I&#39;m high with meth. 😅 These guys wouldn&#39;t know me anyway. Who am I for them to know me. I even don&#39;t remember their gestures. It is not live. It&#39;s what the playscreen says. It was live before I saw it. I love meth it makes everything true for me. Ahehe . . . True true true true true!
2479,"I am from Finland, and have to say Biden isnt ok, is he ill , sometimes I think he is out what is wrong."
2480,"No, that $100 basket of groceries is now $320"
2481,Trump is clueless 😂😂😂😂
2482,"Thank you for your service Mr. President. Now it&#39;s time to leave the office with some modicum of dignity, and also giving your party some type of a chance in the election. 🙄"
2483,You could believe they r coming from parallele worlds where things are the opposite.
2484,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=851"">14:11</a> Biden has seen the other side"
2485,"Stupid garbage by both parties.  The idea that the US is a 3rd world country or that the US is uniformly disrespected is just as preposterous.  The US despite the junk from both parties and their stiffling burocracies continues to expand its enormously capable infrastructure and  its monetary value that makes deficits irrelevant. The most relevant issues relate to extent to which government  monopolizes scarce resources especially labor and hinders creativity by failing to reduce and consolidate outmoded unnecessary laws and regulations while failing to put far more emphasis on protecting us from domestic white collar  and financial system crime and  deeply rooted highly dangerous actual and latent  cyber-attacks by hostile countries esp Russia, NKorea and China."

2495,satu pro putin satu pro china?sedangkan rusia dan china bersahabat saat ini dlm (BRICKS)..kesimpulan disini demokrat dan rebublik yg bermasaalah(mereka)siapapun yg menang usa tetap usa?
2496,It’s amazing how Biden can deny about the border problem
2497,"I still don&#39;t understand how a country like the U.S, most of the time elect people too old to run a country like theirs. I mean there are great potential candidates young and energetic to run such a great country. The good thing is <br>Next election will have new candidates for Americans to choose from."
2498,"That&#39;s right blame it all on the immigrants - talk to any political scientist, Trump&#39;s just like any other populist : making America great, clean water and air to solve climate change, saying that Biden is just about a criminal - at least he wants to tax the rich and address the issues with actions not banter. I think America could do with smarter leaders, and Biden is getting on in years but he seems to know how grave the situation is, while Trump&#39;s all about charm"
2499,Notice the hand Signals to Biden from the Moderator.

2504,"That is something,I love in American Drmocracy"
2505,And yet we are a superpower... go figure. To all the people that say this country is the greatest in the world I suggest opening your eyes a little wider.
2506,"You are right mr.president Trump, we are sinking fast under biden,did so much better with Trump in charge he is the real man for the job"

2517,Trump I don’t know what  Biden said I so confuse. Too !
2518,REMEMBER THIS: THERE IS A low OCCULT campaign to start  and discredit a honest stuttering President by emotional AND NOT ON SUBSTANCE triggers.<br>Their plan as internal &amp; foreign plotters Won&#39;t Work against young and good hearted positive people...!
2519,Bother their response to drug addiction is equivalent to blame the gun not the person. 🤦‍♂️
2520,😟
2521,This was a bad night but Joe Biden is FAR more capable and I&#39;d MUCH rather have him in office than a convicted criminal!
2522,Looks like neither of them are a good fit for president of the US. Neither of them have a concrete idea of doing something better other than just blaming each other.  Waste of time.
2523,The Debate

2528,"Roe v Wade is the most important issue, and Biden is pro-women’s rights. Vote Biden!"
2529,Biden might vote for Trump after this debate 😂
2530,1000% Biden got all the questions pre hand
2531,"As an Aussie, THIS IS GOLD 😂 <br><br>Haha Trump V What ever that mumbling thing next to him is 😂😂😂"
2532,"Honestly all the inflation talk when Trump was president as a single mom I could afford to provide for me and my daughter, but now? I&#39;m thankful to have a partner to help me because when Biden came into office I lost my home my vehicle and many days my daughter was the only one to eat. My job didn&#39;t change I worked 16&#39;s multiple times a week to try and keep a roof over my families head."
2533,Most of the time Biden stood with his mouth slightly open; it was noticeable that he was trying to understand the essence of what was happening and these efforts were extremely difficult for him.  Only a blind person would not see that an old sick person needs to retire!
2534,"When history is written Trump will go down as the best president of this century and possibly the best president ever since General GEORGE.  AND T is right that the world hates Biden and loves Trump. And the more the propaganda empire villianozes Trump, the more everyone loves him because we all know how stupid everything targeted against Trump.   The only ones who thinks it’s legit in the CNN zombies.  NO one that thinks for themselves thinks anything but that Trump is a true patriot and might very well end up saving our country from being taken over by communist criminals.  Masked as Democratic Socialism.  Even president Reagan said if communists rears its ugly head and sneaks in it will be under the guise of democratic socialism and through the democrats and DNC.  Trump worked harder than nearly anyone before him.   Every time Biden starts with his turn he says.  Everything he said are lies, not true.   Blah blah.  Biden is a criminal that steals from taxpayers and he thinks he can say who a patriot is???   Definitely not him or his lackey friends."
2535,"When history is written Trump will go down as the best president of this century and possibly the best president ever since General GEORGE.  AND T is right that the world hates Biden and loves Trump. And the more the propaganda empire villianozes Trump, the more everyone loves him because we all know how stupid everything targeted against Trump.   The only ones who thinks it’s legit in the CNN zombies.  NO one that thinks for themselves thinks anything but that Trump is a true patriot and might very well end up saving our country from being taken over by communist criminals.

2536,Lets go Brandon!
2537,"NATO has become a transnational corporation (disadvantages of globalization) that is trying to dictate its will to the United States and Europe (supranational level), to recruit their presidents, perhaps promising them something or maybe covertly threatening them. After all, NATO is geographically located in Brussels (Europe), and not in the United States"
2538,"Biden was just lucky to win the election 2021, while the US people mistakenly thought that Trump was not coping with the coronavirus, the US people thought that Biden would do better in 2021 and did not even imagine what kind of mess they would get into with this Biden. Biden has worsened the country in all directions, inflation, the southern border, life has become expensive and unsafe, further more, Biden does not care about the people at all, when they tell him about it, he smiles and when asked what you say why people are unhappy, he answers: I do not blame them for being unhappy. How high is Biden&#39;s ego, a lot of narcissism"
2539,"why is Biden trying to brainwash everyone, allegedly Russia is trying to restore the USSR. This is nonsense. The reason for Russia&#39;s actions is that the United States sponsored a coup in Ukraine in 2014. and then they began to exterminate the civilian population of Donbass, to bring NATO troops into Ukraine, pulling them up to the borders of Russia, and this after Russia left the GDR in 1994 (It was Russia that ruled a country like the USSR), believing NATO&#39;s promises. and Biden&#39;s son participated in bio-weapon laboratories created by the United States and Ukraine on the territory of Ukraine. Russia is just ensuring its security. At one time, the United States helped destroy the USSR and, among other things, split Ukraine from Russia. Russia does not interfere with Europe in any way, Ukraine is not a member of the European Union, but Europe is very concerned about Russophobic sentiments, because of economic envy, to the point that Europe has the audacity to supply weapons to Ukraine. It is clear to everyone what kind of organization NATO is and by whom it is run. if Russia wanted to, there would have been no Europe for a long time, but Russia does not do this, because it understands that it is necessary to ensure peace and prevent a big war, only to protect its borders and Russian people, and to stop the lawless power in Ukraine that came through a coup in 2014"
2540,"Biden is trying to explain with open flattery and words the United States is a great country that his presidency is very good, that is, in fact, he is not praising the country but praising himself"
2541,Bidden need stay at home and play with his kid. He is too young to be president 😂
2542,"alright, watching biden saying &quot;weprofudodp prusic forece aah&quot; is a bit weird<br><br>greetings from Russia"
2543,"Biden talks such nonsense about taxes, and always says number 1, number 2, as if some psychologist taught him that he should always bring at least 2 counterarguments, even if they are sucked out of his finger and complete nonsense."
2544,"I heard Biden say that he had cut spending on black children. how he can say such a thing on a public TV... Well, as for drugs, what Trump says under Biden has increased, of course, and Biden apparently takes them, and Zelensky and for the the Armed Forces of Ukraine are needed, because they come from somewhere, it&#39;s clear from where. So it&#39;s clear that Biden is to blame for this."
2545,Joe Biden worst president in USA history is what he’ll be known for.
2546,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=712"">11:52</a> bruh there&#39;s no absolute way"

2548,He just had a cold and a bad night.
2549,Trump is so bad mouthed 😂😂😂 <br>The indirect shade 😂<br>They sound like old married couple in counseling or going through divorce 😂
2550,When Biden speaks I&#39;m just reminded of 3rd grade school plays where I just said my lines so I can go back home &amp; drink my strawberry milk. No passion behind it. Just saying what they wanted me to get out. No pushing to get more words out. No emotion. It just feels like these questions were rehearsed for Biden to respond to. They cut him off before he can get any more incoherent or redundant in his ramblings. I really hope even if trump loses they just let him out &amp; enjoy his last days in his own world. I really feel bad for the guy. Theyre squeezing all they can out of him like rolling toothpaste.
2551,BIden :-😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦
2552,I don&#39;t know if Biden is under influence of drugs or 🤔🫣

2564,"&quot;Они говорили друг другу, что скорее согласились бы сделаться на один год разбойниками в Шервудском лесу, чем президентами Соединенных Штатов на всю жизнь&quot;. М. Твен"
2565,That was embarrassing.
2566,Did Trump answer any questions....Billions of Billions of unanswered questions. Imagine a debate where there was zero finger pointing and questions were actually answered.
2567,These guys😂😂
2568,I’m so disappointed. God help us.
2569,"I think a cognitive skills test should be done on any candidate before taking charge, I&#39;m literally zoning out on the stupidity and lack of logic and reasoning, sir please step aside and calm down"
2570,Its kinda frustrating that a lot of the questions they are asking are not being answered by either person...
2571,Rip the baby out on the 9th mouth? Is he talking about premature births? Woman are pregnant typically for 37 to 42 weeks 8.5 to 9.6 mouths

2583,Biden also looks as this is the first time he’s ever heard this every time trump says facts.  And looks upset that the moderators aren’t backing him up
2584,I think it is the policy and his track record of getting things done and whether he kept his word after he was elected and how long term his vision is and what methodology he used to build the path towards that and whether his vision for global balance and peace was intricately and fairly constructed — is what you should be arguing about instead of his humane mistakes that anyone can make. No one is perfect. Come on America. I thought your hearts were as big as your thighs and waists and Big Mac jumbo sets! You being so small right now on Biden!

2601,Biden&#39;s reactions are killing me 😂
2602,"IF you criticize Biden, your comments get blocked. Imagine that! FOAD Biden."
2603,"I&#39;d vote for Biden in coma than voting for Trump. Besides, if he dies, Kamala Harris would still do a better job than Trump. I used to think that George W.

2620,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=84"">1:24</a> Biden attacks Trump about holding his own bag playing golf. Really? I just saw a short where Trump prevented Melanie from falling when she tripped. Biden can barely support his own skeletal system and can barely talk let alone catch a woman when she falls or carry his own golf clubs. He calls Trump a whiner but he attack Trump in an area that the whole entire nation knows is a weak jab because we have all witnessed him stumble. He should feel ashamed for saying something so stupid, childish, and obviously that of a desperate man because his opponent is far stronger physically and politically. That was weak and pathetic and the attack of a scared and whiney man. Trump was strong, passionate, civil, and dignified."
2621,"Svako zna da ce opet namestiti da biden pobedi, kao sto su i 2020 godine namestili za bidena"
2622,"I like the part where Biden coughed and slowly raised his hand to cover his mouth, way too late, then left his hand there for a good 5 seconds."
2623,"Candidates for elections in the USA are a logical consequence of the life and development of society. On the one hand, a megalomaniac and maniac, a liar and an arrogant braggart with a mission to dominate the world stage. His opponent depicts a part of society cut off from reality, the consequences and the tragedy that his policy is causing around the world. Both puppets of excessive ego who, from a position of power and calculation throughout history, deceive themselves and everyone around them. Both victims of a system that cannot change, creating the illusion of rivalry, complement each other."
2624,And they still want Trump to give up running for President even when Biden can&#39;t get his words straight

Dangerous precedent democrats want to set, blatantly making up evidence to prosecute political opponents.<br><br>I try to be an honest person I know this already happens but at least they take the time to cover it up and not do it in public in front of everyone and then have half the population ADVOCATING for there to be no prosecution. This is literally disgusting and be honest with yourself doesn&#39;t it sound like I&#39;m talking about a third world country? <br><br>Sadly no we are literally the worlds police as of this moment, and you really think the world is going to let us continue in that role as we have political witch hunts like this? I&#39;m fairly certain we are going to get into a few more wars coming up and we won&#39;t be the good guys and it&#39;s because of our habit of causing coups in places like Ukraine and Libya but never talking about that part then blast the WORLD with propaganda about the events that came AFTER the coup."

2735,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2390"">39:50</a> .. this is how I feel .. shame on his wife and shame on his party for pushing him into these debates shame on u <br><br>Trump 2024 …. By a LANDSLIDE"
2736,I fear the united states with what ever head is ruling. I disagree with both these guys. I dont know. I feel sad.
2737,I cant even watch it frozen  like joe
2738,Bidenwas slow and sluggish early on. I&#39;m sorry but its the yruth.Biden seemed very odd too me.i just eanyed too help him to bed.
2739,Ya like a movie you already saw but it’s so good you watch it again
2740,Sleept joe
2741,"Every time trump speaking , Joe Biden ==&gt; 🥱😴"
2742,These two?? Obviously no democracy. Neither candidates should even be selling vacuum cleaners
2743,You know the US is a thing of the past and is done when you see these guys are your 2 potential presidents....sad end for America bye usa until next time and good luck joining the developping countries you once made fun of...now you are the joke of the world...what a shame so much lost potential it could&#39;ve really been great but it&#39;s over now 💙
2744,"Trump talked the same way the first time around but the media did such a good job making it look like ignorance most believed it. now when the media says Trump is talking crazy, we are saying is he really?"
2745,"Is this the LAST RECENT DEBATE because if you TYPE that question IN YOU GET NO RESPONSE=== very slick of the NEWS MEDIA or YOU TUBE??????? Anyhow I,LL TURN THIS OFF and go right to BARNABY JONES because CANDIDATE GUY #1 says &quot;&quot;&quot;UNDER MY REGIME WE HAD THE BEST 25 FLAVOURINGS FOR COFFEE!!!&quot;&quot;&quot; then CANDIDATE #2 GUY says &quot;&quot;&quot; UNDER MY REGIME WE WARNED AMERICAN CITIZENS OF COFFEE FLAVOURINGS!!!!&quot;&quot;&quot; So I,LL stay home on ELECTION DAY and SWITCH TO TEA*<b>****</b>"
2746,Trump wins the election by one vote. He tries to find out who the last vote was. It was Biden. He then says to Biden &quot;after all this you still voted for me?&quot; Trump then changes his vote to Biden which then makes it a tie. They both get very emotional. Biden then leans in and makes out with trump on national television.They run away and live the rest of their lives together. Which leaves Kanye west as the 47th president of the United States.
2747,I will take a person that Stutters over a dishonest Multibillionaire.
2748,"Отпустите уже Байдена на покой! Ему тяжело. Он уже заслужил теплый плед, мягкие тапочки и симпатичную сиделку."
2749,CNN did a great job moderating the debate by muting mics and such... Biden coming out all sleepy like &quot;Hey folks how are ya.. good to be here&quot;. 😂

2789,Parkinson&#39;s disease is a very deadly disease. He&#39;s probably been like this for who knows how long.
2790,Great. Someone who thinks it&#39;s an abortion if you kill the baby after it&#39;s born vs someone too old to make a coherent sentence.<br><br>This is both hilarious to watch and absolutely terrifying to remember that I live here.

2798,Jo sounds like he got a washrag in his mouth.
2799,"It appears to me that Biden is only running against Trump as a vengeance not as an actual opponent. Sadly, I don’t think he has the country in mind."

2805,I felt so embarrassed whenever Biden speaks.
2806,Joe looks so confused
2807,I hate Trump but he&#39;s the only one here still quite aware of what is going on and what he is saying.
2808,It’s wild that in 2024 Biden wants to give only black peolle tax credits towards buying a home<br><br>This is racist and a violation of the constitution

And, also,<br>This is one that will most definitively get funded!<br><br><br>When I become (Vice) President, <br>the first thing I&#39;d do is sign off on a couple crucial Executive Orders <br>focused on Mental Health and wellness in our leading Enforcement positions:<br>√ Hiring Therapists and or Psychiatrists per Precinct with a client/doctor confidentiality, keeping our Officers on the force and maintaining a non-bias, non-mandated reporter-type basis; reprimanding, retraining, not removing;<br>√ Hiring at least (1) Law Professional per State to mitigate negligible, reoccurring persons and cases to escalate and determine an equitable, fair outcome prior to all-or-nothing offenses occur; to aid, not (necessarily) make life changes or decisions;<br>√ Mandating CDL-Training (and potentially Hiring Process mitigation) within our Prison System, and a broader-scaled Technical Training within our Jail System;<br>as well as<br>√ Hiring, at the very least, a graveyard crew of ~7, per state, maintaining our Country&#39;s registry.<br>These,<br>I wholeheartedly believe key, when building upon, holding, and in keeping, a career. There should never be despondency; <br>if <br>there&#39;s an issue, should we not be alotted to on-the-job training?<br>if <br>there&#39;s emotional turmoil, should we not be alotted on-the-job resources?<br>if<br>we&#39;re to be hired initially, should we not have job security?<br>In Every Job Position!<br><br>Then there&#39;s <br>• border protection which is absolutely imperative; <br>Key fundamentals of Democratic policies like:<br>• maintaining Women&#39;s Rights (my body, my choice) in her right for an abortion, equality in the workspace, and full equality in general; <br>• fighting for our citizens and trying to be the voice for everyone; <br>• lowering our deficit;<br>• focusing on Climate Change in every aspect from Agriculture and Permaculture, to species (on the brink of extinction) rehabilitation and reassimilation, to finding better pesticide and insecticide products that won&#39;t harm our critical, benign insects like pollinators and seasonal nomadic; to stopping Any New big Oil and Gas development agreements;<br>• working with all our World Leaders to create policies best for us, as the United States of America, but also best for our World, globally; <br>and<br>so much more<br><br>I would change so much of our marginalized communities, as I can surely stress that it&#39;s these citizens who take the brunt, from every level.

It&#39;s clear to see that the Real Estate market is leading our Economy and Society without a single thread of oversight, and it&#39;s with shortsighted policies like these that skew, misrepresent, and shatter the current divide of our current American society;<br>• Immigration Reform:<br>Process and Deportation with a negotiable Warning or added Criminal charges if the subject is already within the system and these undocumented crossings are continuous;<br>• Refugee Asylum Reform:<br>Strict Background Check and applicating process, Case Management oversight with weekly (1)+ hour appointments, mandatory job seeking (3)+ per appointment, Governmental subsidies never be granted ~(10)+ years, supplemental housing never be granted ~(10)+ years;<br>• Filibuster Reform:<br>Perfect Proposals, instrumental Acts, life-changing Bills, imperative Amendments that are yielded on the floor, with a system in place of voted-upon of Yeays or Nays, unless getting at least the simple majority in the House (218/435), and concurrently the simple majority in the Senate (51/100), they&#39;re dead on arrival, and the only pressure we have is filibustering.

2813,I had such a good time.
2814,Biden looks evil...
2815,Evil evil and evil what a future for allof as
2816,Trump always mean muggin.
2817,May be a Boxing match before the election. 😅
2818,Biden is lying things have never been so High and this is very difficult for people on fixed income and very hard for the people of this country cannot buy a house or rent an apartment this is ridiculous raising taxes and the interest rate and it is going to crash the economy and put us in a Depression
2819,This is the person with the nuclear code? I&#39;m scared.
2820,COMEDY GOLD 😆😆😆
2821,Look at him Biden is not all the way there
2822,Trump is going to win this election
2823,Standing on own foot for so long ! Commendable job Mr. President
2824,"I agree on the surface tax cuts for corporations etc seem unfair but those companies then are able to put more jobs in America versus overseas where they avoid the taxes ,thus providing more jobs for Americans"
2825,$100 groceries now $120!!that’s a joke it’s at least double!!
2826,Bidens defense: he is lying!
2827,"Trump is ready to rumble, Biden is ready to mumble"

2836,They did not go by the rules moderaters sucked
2837,You did it Joe.
2838,2020 election was stolen
2839,Why a country so great like America has only these two very old men to lead them? I really wonder 🤔
2840,It&#39;s like Kendrick Vs Drake😂
2841,Everytime biden was saying « the idea » he was like : 😬 it felt like he was bout to say « the iKea »
2842,"Joe, you gotta go."
2843,Who else feels unbearable pity for Joe? The fact that those closest to him are using and encouraging him is disgusting. Jill should be ashamed.
2844,Watching from France i really enjoyed that South Park episode.
2845,"Out of all the great human beings in the US, you guys have a pick of these two bongos bravo 👏🏽"
2846,"I know I don&#39;t get to follow politics as much as I should, and honestly I&#39;m not sure it matters who is at the head if the Congress, Senate and House are actually working for the good of all people. <br><br>That said, this was a disgrace. When will candidates act like gentlemen again and not children. To say they laid out any good information would be an extreme overstatement. <br><br>Neither one answered the child care costs. Wouldn&#39;t matter anyway. If there&#39;s a cost hike, everything and everyone needs a hike to even it out. At some point the number is irrelevant. The McDonald&#39;s employees will be paid$1000/hr and gas will be $300/gal."
2847,"So is this the US Presidential Debate in 2024?<br>With the Republician Representative Donald Trump yapping over there on the left and Democratic Party Representative Joe Biden putting  an 😦 face on the right.<br>Out of all the 90 minutes of the debate, there&#39;s barely any question that was answered, they were just having a chit-chat of arguing that the opponent&#39;s the worst presidents. When they&#39;re being ask about whether they&#39;re capable of being elected as the President of the United States for the next 4 years, what the debaters being arguing is about golf... Is this even revelent to the question? <br>Literally, no solution that was given to solve these problems, espically for whether womens have the right to abortion. Joe Biden over there were just talking about a case that happened when there was a women that was rapped by illegal immigrants, whereas Donald Trump over there were blaming Joe Biden for letting the illegal immigrants into the border (and that&#39;s basically what Trump being saying throughout the debate). I wonder if Joe Biden has been drinking alcohol before the debate, because he&#39;s seriously drunk by mentioning about &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; rapping an women when he&#39;s the person who&#39;s responsible for opening up the border at Texas. <br><br>The scary thing about this debate is not that what they&#39;re debating, it&#39;s how there&#39;s only two people to vote."
2848,its wrong to abuse grandpar in the nursing home.
2849,"It’s crazy that a man with dementia sounds more logical than Trump. Trump is reactive and defensive. He is just defending himself with lies and deflection. I like Trump and I think he has some valid point about the economy, but he really comes off as a guy without a real plan. This is terrible for America. Trump is right. America is turning into a third world country, where crooks with money is the only candidate option to run the country. One is worse than the other 🤦‍♂️"
2850,That picture of Biden is from like 2012 🤣🤣🤣
2851,"😂😂😂 These comments, I&#39;m dead!!!"
2852,"Very true! Trump was the worst President the USA ever had since the start of this beautiful Country AMERICA history. Trump should not be allowed to go back to the white house. Please, please do not let him be back coz he is a person who thinks of himself only."
2853,"Mr trump how can you think to stop Social Security, how do you think we old Americans will live on. Remember we earned our Social Security pention with our hard works n contributed for that."
2854,"What trump did of calling Biden a criminal is very bad thing to say n very disrespectful to say to a President, also we can say that is assignation of character. I would not vote  him even if he were the only candidate."
2855,My joy is only reading coments😂😂

2861,"Its laughable how &quot;politics&quot; in USA goes now. No matter who will take cabinet. War is inevitable, since they in same system. Trump only using current situation around Israel &amp; Ukraine as an excuses, but he did nothing to prevent escalation in Ukraine when he was in charge.

2871,Yes they are and they&#39;re draining our system thanks a lot Biden
2872,Were these two clowns seriously arguing about who is the better golfer?
2873,Hey Biden what about your illegal underground government where you are standing by letting these covens rip off the American people? What about that and you&#39;re stolen election?
2874,Oh you mean Obama&#39;s cages Good for you
2875,Try not to laugh part 97 | 2024 presidential debate

2887,"Having listened to this debate up to the Israel- Hamas issue, I  conclude Biden is not Obama, but he isn&#39;t a write off as many claim. He&#39;s a better deal for the Americans than Trump. He could be having old age issues, but he the better of two evils unless the Democrats  can pick a replacement now."
2888,Shameless Biden talking biggest supporter of war criminals and Nazis.
2889,Any Biden supporters in these comments?????? Didn’t think so 😏

2903,How many times does Biden say “Oh and by the way”….
2904,Who would have guessed that this would end up being one of the most consequential debates in American history?<br><br>Edit: And Biden drops out-oh boy
2905,I have listened for a couple of  minutes. Both Biden and Trump need step down. We need younger leaders.
2906,"Look at Bidens face, mouth gaping open, blank stare, incoherent sentences and the list goes on. Biden’s the President? What a sham."
2907,Awas pd2 in jerman digu.

2911,Trump being braindead metaphorically. Biden being braindead LITERALLY<br><br>Hilarious
2912,I can&#39;t believe this is the best we have to offer.  Makes me want to run for President!!
2913,"All Trump had to do was speak honestly and he&#39;d have won the debate.  Instead, all Trump did was prove why George Santos is STILL the perfect poster-child for today&#39;s Republican party."
2914,"Biden was sharp, and didn’t fail, except for one time in a lengthy portion. His voice was weak, but millions of people have weak voices, and don’t get promotions to higher paying jobs because of that, so the problem is the capitalist wage system that causes world poverty because they expect and need some unemployed workers…who then can’t buy food or medical care for their children. <br><br>Danny Thomas started St. Jude Children’s Hospital to help children who get cancer and their families get treatment because millions couldn’t afford any medical care. His vision evolved from wanting to build a general hospital in the early 1950’s, to becoming a Children’s cancer research hospital, which opened in 1962 and is still funded by generous donors. At that time children had a 20% survival rate, and now has a 94% survival rate for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, using therapy that does not include radiation in 2006."
2915,me as neutral non american need to say: biden is the biggest clown in the history of the us. i remember a time where usa was the best countrry everyone wasd looking up to but now its just a shadow of its own.
2916,"🍿 I can’t talk right now , I’m watching the season finale of the United States"

2921,This is just akward at this point
2922,I am Canadian but This video shows how Biden is well educated man. I can not get a sense of Trump responses. Biden seems to be baby sitting Donald.

2929,The fact Biden did actually label black people super predators is beyond wild in the act to change law and conviction towards black people
2930,"Trump win for USA win for Italia, save the world!"
2931,"As far as drug addiction, I think at some point we need to stop coddling the addict.  There are programs if the addict is serious about getting help.  For the president to be responsible for these addicts&#39; actions is ridiculous.."
2932,The real president isn’t born yet.
2933,Yup hypocrites
2934,I don&#39;t know who is telling Biden that he is doing all this good stuff.  I don&#39;t see any of it.  I still live paycheck to paycheck and can&#39;t afford health care.  I won&#39;t be able to afford Medicare when I retire either.
2935,I don’t think biden did bad - all Trump did was lying
2936,Black Mirror&#39;s best episode yet.

2944,😢
2945,Biden lost the walk to the podium and lost America every second after
2946,And the big winner is not the big guy
2947,Why can&#39;t trump answer a question without bashing Biden?
2948,I never knew that elders fights are that bad😂
2949,When the woman sitting said thank you so loud when biden was talking and he was like:🤦🤦
2950,I don&#39;t think biden can talk anymore 😊
2951,"Why does it look like Biden is referring to answers on his tablets of paper? I thought the media was not to provide these questions to the candidates prior to the debate, but at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2038"">33:58</a> there&#39;s old Joe, turning pages like he&#39;s moving ahead with the next answers he&#39;s been provided. Who is running the United States of America? Why is the MSM covering for these traitors?"
2952,They are both old   i bet my grandpa will be a better president 😂
2953,The idea and by the way 2 lines this FJB used
2954,"Stop calling him President Trump, He is CONVICTED Trump."
2955,pra quem entende o que esta sendo dito pode perceber que como sempre ambos falam a pura verdade
2956,"President Trump, Pass on deciding on picking sides. THIS ELECTIONS IS FOR HELPING THE WHOLE AMERICA, NO WAR, NO ASSASSINATION NOTRICKS. REBUILDING INTO THE FUTURE. YOU, ADMIT AMERICA&#39;S MISTAKE AND WRONGS SO THAT YOU ALL CAN BUILD UP NO BRIDGES WITH AFRICA, SOUTH AMERICAS, THE MIDDLE EASTS, RUSSIA AND CHINA.

2961,Trump it’s the right president the right men to be on power in USA
2962,The “idea” that Biden truly believes he’s making sense and is mentally and physically fit to be president is flabbergasting.
2963,When he said groceries that costed 100 dollars are now 120 he must be talking  dollar tree 😂.
2964,The comment section just made my day 😂. May God help America
2965,Frankly speaking.<br><br>I&#39;m here to see the comment section.

2968,Both old and out of touch ...where the young Americans @???
2969,Wow...I finally got the guts to watch this. I&#39;m so sad now. Its a pity they can&#39;t realise that they are the same person...
2970,Wondering if Biden even knows where he is? he looks lost just the way he&#39;s looking in empty air instead of looking at Trump. Man i just lost in empty air
2971,Biden is dying man.
2972,I searched “Biden debate” and this video was buried under a 100 others.

2974,"Most of you think of the comedy, the truth of the matter is that this is the reason the whole world people are suffering, hunger war exploitation please Americans wake up and help the rest of the world. Do Americans really care what is happening to the rest of the World."
2975,"We are all so screwed. Is this the best we can do? Idiocracy has come home to roost. Both pathological liars, (not even good liars). Popostras statements both sides.  It was like watching two children go at it. We are so screwed....."

2999,"If Biden wins, US is doomed."
3000,Let’s go Brandon
3001,I felt sorry for Biden too. Whoever is running that country shouldn’t have put him out there.
3002,"As Donald Trump says the war between Russia and Ukraine should never have been started, end of story. Donald Trump best president of USA ever"
3003,Oh is Biden talking about that chip deal that pelosi set up because she had insider trading on it?
3004,"At this point, the best solution might be to change the rules and let Obama have a third term! Biden and Trump have turned politics into a circus—let&#39;s bring back the ringmaster! 🎪🇺🇸"
3005,Good luck world.
3006,IDK how democrats believe all the lies Biden told and the moderators need to add a fact checker to these debates to keep the candidates honest unforutbately we have alot of guillible people watching this.
3007,So are we talking about politics or golf?
3008,"If the U.S. doesn&#39;t have the greatest economy in the world, then who?"

3015,I&#39;m going to start wearing a really long power tie.
3016,Trumps best move was not roasting joe and just letting him bury himself
3017,&quot;I call it Biden Migrant Crime&quot;
3018,Trump❤❤❤
3019,"I’m a Canadian, so this is hilarious but also incredibly scary and sad. I could watch squirrels talk better than this."
3020,I got a huge bump in pay THE DAY trump took office(ARMY). Idk what joes talking about
3021,"The blank stare , there once was a lot but these days there’s between those ears. I honestly start to feel bad but then I remember this is voluntary , he needs to just retire and enjoy his “golden years”"
3022,Ofc the number of illegal border crossings dropped . . . YOU MADE IT LEGAL. I’m an independent but Biden makes the choice so easy
3023,"Look at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2770"">46:10</a>. Biden couldn’t even express himself that he wanted to rebuddle trumps response and they gave Biden the time without him even asking<br><br>When it’s trump asking he has to fight for the time"
3024,The beginning started with lies.
3025,"After this video, I decided to vote in favor of Trump bro"
3026,"My opinion: Let’s be real here, Even not Obama, I would vote Mr Romney over Mr Trump and Joe. Look what we have today, just two guys talking about whose golf is better and beating Medicare. In 2012 election, at least they are answering different questions fluently with reverent points, and not hesitating and muttering before every single sentence like Biden did, it’s sad and worrying to see that Michelle Obama is not going to run for president. because under modern Democracy rules, If Joe Biden doesn’t want to quit, we will be left with Trump and Biden 🗿, <br><br><br><br>but let’s be real here, Trump is WAY better than Joe in terms of points and topics, though he lied what appears to be over 30 times, he is still the crowd favourite and better that the other one (Biden). Whether you like him or not, he is still one of the most successful and smart businessman and never make America look weak, he is the obvious choice here.<br><br>P.S. Back to 2012 to see what a REAL presidential debate needs to have."

3029,Wes ina ☻️✅️
3030,Biden be dyin…
3031,first comment
3032,あしたのジョー
3033,He looks like an 80 year old man who has worked for his last 60 years. My grandfather had dimensia. And Joe certainly doesn&#39;t look like he has alzheimers.  He&#39;s put a great cabinet together. A president shouldn&#39;t be doing the majority of the work. Plus Joe has Obama to help him run the country. Obama pulled the US out of a recession. Joe Biden helped the US avoid a recession.  All Trump did was lie this whole debate. The US is way more respected then when Trump was the president. Trump put tariffs on China and they went elsewhere to purchase their products putting farmers into bankruptcy. Trump is desperate to become president. He doesn&#39;t want to face the facts of more court cases.
3034,"Это действительно забавно, похоже на шоу. Ну мы в России болеем за Байдена😅 об этом официально заявил Путин когда его спросили"
3035,I feel its like watching the devil taunting jesus with lies when he was on the cross. Yes biden is in a bad place but at least he isn&#39;t a downright liar etc !
3036,Finally the Big Lie that Biden was cognitively fit to be President is  exposed for all to see.
3037,Biden：😮😮😲😲
3038,But to say most of what was and always been to say that we arent the best economy even in are current situation i found to be very wrong so where then what does biden think is the nation with the greatest economy if he didnt think were not it
3039,Corperate green he called the problem hum missed that
3040,biden has a cheat sheet! u can see it if you pay close attention!
3041,Trump only knows how to lie
3042,Biden is so lost and Trump being Trump. Either way the world loses.
3043,I actually want Obama back bro 🙁
3044,This was a low intelectual debate.
3045,"It is is simply astonishing how corrupt political leaders who litteraly destroyed their own country in a few years such as Biden or Macron in France have the nerves to pretend they saved it, even when evidence are utterly against them. Just shows how low western countries have sunk with no bottom in sight. Hope Trump prevails in November."
3046,Biden is a liar . Not one bit of truth came out of his mouth. FJB
3047,… да…
3048,did anyone else catch trump calling Biden Brandon at 22;27 😂
3049,"Youtube flat out protects Biden and censors just about ANY TRUTHFUL non vulgar comments directed at his administration. Its a joke. A horrific one. And people want to say Trump is akin to Hitler. 😱😱🤣🤣. People need to start being held accountable for this from top to bottom and be removed from any position they might have and in many cases, brought up on criminal charges. All the lies and supression that are allowing this country to be intentionally self sabotaged are completely what an &quot;attack on democracy&quot; looks like."
3050,It&#39;s like watching the Golden Girls 😂
3051,"JOE BIDEN HAS DONE A HORRIBLE JOB, TRUMP DID BETTER WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT. THEY BOTH HAVE SERVED 4 YEARS AS PRESIDENT, SO WE&#39;VE LIVED THRU BOTH THEIR PRESIDENCY&#39;S. WAS AMERICA BETTER DURING TRUMP, OR DURING BIDEN? THE EVIDENCE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF..."
3052,Biden said 1000 trillionaries? God help you americans.
3053,we’re cooked.
3054,age limit for the love of god age limit
3055,"I&#39;m not a fan of Trump at all, but Trump absolutely owned Biden in this interview. Biden is senile, confused and totally demented."

3068,VOTE TRUMP GUYS!! DEMORATS DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!
3069,I guess voting Kanye West to be President is not that bad afterall
3070,All you do is lie Joe.
3071,The whole time Biden looked like he was trying to remember if he left the oven on or not
3072,Debate between the President and the main opposition leader on the same television program.<br><br>It is sad that this is not something that can happen in Turkey.
3073,Biden is a joke
3074,"While you have been sleeping, Joe, our nation has gone to the pits! Do yourself a favor and listen to someone who knows how to run our country!! Donald Trump!!!"
3075,As a Indian i will say its look like a roasting show😅
3076,Its like a train wreck...you cant look away.
3077,&quot;he went to the funeral&#39;..how dare he show some respect!

3083,Joe I was in the navy we have the worst broken down ships ever worst military I ever seen . Wake up from your nap joe joe
3084,"Sadly Biden is old, being old is better than being selfish and scammer. I don&#39;t trust Trump, he can negotiate with Putin for personal gains"
3085,trump sounds like a total narcissist among all the other things…I don’t know how we have let go of all standards when it comes to presidential candidates. I don’t even know how this “debate” is real. just a bunch of pointing fingers
3086,Resident  yes  &quot;Resident&quot; Biden says &quot;the Government should decide on a woman&#39;s health&quot;   yet he mandates a Vagseen<br>Hypocrisy much?

3094,"Biden is a a real nightmare for USA SOCIETY,"
3095,puppet show
3096,Tremp ❤
3097,I don’t get why people are surprised at Biden’s performance. I genuinely couldn’t tell a difference between this debate performance and all the other times I’ve seen him speak.
3098,How does anyone not see these repeating patterns? <br>Biden opens the border then blames everyone for not passing a border bill<br><br>Biden gives Iran 6 billion dollars then Hamas attacks Israel and hezbollah has a 2.5 billion dollar military <br><br>Biden is weak on Putin with zero diplomacy then Putin attacks Ukraine<br><br>This idiot creates all these problems then tries to either take credit for trying to fix it or passes blame
3099,Something wrong with your analysis
3100,"Biden is too old and not excuses, he’s been done nothing worthwhile since he’s been all his life."
3101,I’m voting for Trump and without excuses nor exemptions
3102,"I grew up in a time where you were not supposed to say anything negative about the president, but I have to say that our current president has screwed up on just about everything! And, you aren&#39;t fooling anyone by opening our borders to get the only votes you will probably get. Please pass the office to one of the best presidents we&#39;ve ever had, Donald Trump!!!!!"
3103,"1hr and 40min straight of disparaging the other party and making outrageously false statements, on both sides. is this seriously the two people it comes down to? give me a f8cking break"
3104,Am going with trump 🎉🎉
3105,Ask him what a computer chip does
3106,He’s way to old
3107,Trust the dog first
3108,Biden you lost touch with Americans when companies move out of America. When you forced them too
3109,"As a middle class citizen, I was far financially better off under the Trump Administration than this current joke of an Administration.. 🤷"
3110,This is truly sad
3111,Joes worst appearance yet.
3112,Can’t believe he is our president!!!!!! Does anyone see this!!!!
3113,Does public housing included with this?????????
3114,"Why media has to host this presidential debates. CNN where do you get your numbers for the reality of inflation. From 100 to 120 bucks basket of groceries. The only way this can be truth is a basket of maruchan noodles packets. No milk, no bread, and no eggs.😢"
3115,Biden is taking his nap
3116,Trump really didn’t have to say anything. Just let Biden talk and he wins.
3117,"Good job, WSJ, you edited out all of Biden&#39;s senior moments! Cheaters!"
3118,Gee we can see who YouTube wants in the White House.<br>EVERYTIME TRUMP STARTS TO SPEAK YOUtube goes to s commercial (ad).Not once did YouTube go to commercial while BUMBLER BIDUM spoke.🤔🤔🤔

3120,Where are the rest of the Americans now?
3121,Biden your debunked
3122,Wow should be none
3123,You killed it trump!!!!

3127,Why is joe  reading from cards ?
3128,Biden is like a sloth and Trump does nothing but tell humongous LIES.
3129,Biden is big liar
3130,"No one over 70 allowed to run... they have a minimum age, they definitely need a maximum age."
3131,"I think Trump has proven himself to be shamelessly narcissistic, which is never a good trait for a president. But watching this country vote Biden into office and then be so okay with his clear dementia and mental state, makes me think this country is a joke. Most of my close circle are openly democratic and push everyone to vote that way, but for Christ sake it&#39;s as if we are seeing two different things when talking about biden. Nobody in their right mind would want this man as their country&#39;s puppet as the administration does what they want in the background."
3132,Biden is logical and does not praise himself much  Trump will cause World War III
3133,I don&#39;t see a difference between this and a TNTL vine compilation from 2016
3134,Best debate trump has ever done. Honestly very mature

3140,"We went from voting for who we want, to voting against who we don&#39;t want and this is what we&#39;ve come to? We need a &#39;third party&#39; We need Ross Perot for president (a real businessman and not a &#39;big city conman&#39;) and Jesse Ventura for Vice President!"

3149,Biden is a person who prefer peace. ❤
3150,J.Biden sounds like ASMR but an annoying kind. Sadly.
3151,The Ukraine has Hotter Women than the Israelis.
3152,"Next time it’s gonna directly take place in the retirement home 😂😂😂<br><br><br>As an European this debate is just so absurd and unreal to me that it’s almost funny, but then I remember that these two clowns are potentially gonna be the next president of the US and that’s where it gets sad"
3153,Biden... He&#39;s reading... He literally sounds like he&#39;s reading...
3154,Biden won! Has anyone else ever had trouble speaking with this technology attacking us? I remember vividly when former president Trump was president and had difficulty speaking. We need vice President Kamala Harris to stay home and help with what she has experience in…civil rights against abuse and torture.
3155,"&quot;You ever hear any other President say something like &#39;I&#39;m gonna seek retribution&#39; or &#39;Hitler had great ideas&#39;?&quot; <br><br>No, but I&#39;ve heard a President refer to a group of voters as a racial slur (the only President to ever use a racial slur when referring to American citizens), and he was a Democrat! 🤡"
3156,😂❤
3157,They should have to provide trustworthy data sources with their answers.
3158,I don’t know if I herd it write but did trump say that <br>hamas is invading Israel <br>Cause the only people who are getting killed blown up or having there homes exploded are the people  of palatine
3159,Wow biden!! He needs to go home
3160,Neither one cares about child care
3161,Biden needed half an hour for the Ritalin to kick in.
3162,Two jokes on stage. <br>But at least Trump will stop the invasion<br>Butcher Joe is the worst president in US history. The only good thing he did was raise Social Security. But now he&#39;s destroying SSI by giving it to illegal invaders. <br>We need better than both of these
3163,Biden makes me miss my grandpa
3164,Since when personal attacks are the norms in any debate
3165,Biden needs a medical care 24/7 and let trump take over the United States once and for all.
3166,Trump turning his head looking  at biden is crazy 🦜😂
3167,Why is Joe biden putting blame 🙄<br>On Donald trump for every down fall you were president of united states 🇺🇸 of America 🇺🇸 for 4 years you had all the time ⏲️ to fix all these problems why didn&#39;t you ? Joe.  <br><br>When Joe Biden became the president of united states 🇺🇸 of America 🇺🇸 situations started to unfold literally. 😢
3168,We REALLY NEED true Libertarians in the debates. More options! More candidates.
3169,I’m 20 mins in but so far I noticed Biden lies way more than Trump
3170,🎉TRUMP 🎉😂 at least he knows where he is and can form a coherent sentence
3171,"Biden is the NUMBER 1 , NUMBER 2 guy 😂"
3172,A debate of the highest quality. We can all look forward to a new era of dynamism and fresh ideas.
3173,A convicted felon and sexual predator in a presidential debate.  We are charting new territory.  Integrity and honor  don&#39;t seem to exist anymore.  A sexual predator able to run for the Office of the President???????
3174,The civilization will end soon. Looook who are the candidates for US president 😂 omg is this a joke !?
3175,Kinda feel bad for trump he had fo waste  his time debating this clown.
3176,Prices have NOT dropped with Biden. He is also adding more taxes on imports. That raises prices.
3177,I can&#39;t believe these are the 2 best options this country can come up with.<br>They both lie their butts off.
3178,"Liberal &quot;scholars&quot;.. you can&#39;t be a scholar if you are liberal, on paper yes, philosophically no."
3179,Trump rolls over biden
3180,How tf has he not been impeached. We&#39;re living under the most corrupt government that has ever existed. Why do democrats not realize that the earth has been going through climate changes since it&#39;s existence. So sick of our socialist/communist government. A revolution is long needed.
3181,I think Biden is never done anything to his country <br>Trump is a powerful man <br>❤ we wanted Trump must win God save Trump 😊
3182,Hosts were terrible
3183,"The price of food, of groceries, of rent , absolutely everything has done nothing but go up under biden. Food had more than doubled! <br>Biden and his partye are the most vile corrupt monsters that have ever lied in office."
3184,Feel sorry for Biden. It’s pretty clear. He’s being dried across the finish line and he doesn’t know himself.
3185,Biden looks like one of the Ghosts from the haunted mansion 😂😂😂
3186,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4585"">1:16:25</a> nice fart, Donny."

3192,please please please Vote for Trump all of us need to if not we will all be doomed ...
3193,What&#39;s good is you can just fast forward whenever joe speaks.
3194,Watching this instead of the boys
3195,"Hello from Bulgaria 🇧🇬,  there were never been so much corruption, lies from politicians and media and so much despair and poverty into people, how&#39;s  in your country?"
3196,"Creating victims to defend your administration or future economic plan? I&#39;m tired of the Democratic party contaminated by Socialist speech, where they create victims of skin color, victims of price of medication, victims of big companies,  creating victims of genders, yet introducing sexualized books into the children&#39;s school&#39;s libraries, that is their speech self-victimization, the speech of socialist with the tone of communist. America and Americans aren&#39;t victims of none. America is a great nation, their people are hard workers, resilient, unified, entrepreneurial people  that is how it rose to the top of all nations."
3197,"😂”Brandon, just speak to them!” PRESIDENT TRUMP to Bumbling Biden at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1347"">22:27</a>"
3198,America is a big joke
3199,I can&#39;t wait to see Biden be re elected with 700 million votes this time.
3200,He was in France and spoke to all those D-Day hero&#39;s that died.. WOW
3201,The comments section might just be indicative of this upcoming election👀
3202,"Thank you, the real debate no bs intros and voice overs."
3203,&quot;If we finally beat medicare&quot;- Joe Biden
3204,Notice how Biden literally denies everything 😂
3205,the tax system is not fair biden
3206,Both of these guys are not capable to be president. Biden the brain is gone and trump the way he talks about our alias like Europe is scary! He is in love with Russia period and too cocky and talks to much and keeps repeating him self. If there are America&#39;s top candidates we r in trouble for the next 4 years. Better of vote someone else the outcome will be better
3207,"Biden did not come from Scranton😂.  He’s from Delaware, his wife was from Pennsylvania but he’s not.  I’m not sure where that came from"
3208,fake biden
3209,"I feel if Republicans would run anyone but Trump, they would easily win. If Democrats would run anyone but Biden, they would easily win. The worst candidates."
3210,Biden told the biggest lie this evening: Biden said the the border patrol endorsed him and not even 2 minutes later the border patrol&#39;s official twitter tweeted that they never have and never will endorse Joe Biden
3211,democrats 🤝 republicans<br>   &quot;we need better choices&quot;
3212,NATOに加盟しないロシアを使ってNATOを攻撃させるなどと発言した大統領はザユナイテッドステイツオブアメリカ史上おそらくこのプレジデントだけだ。<br>　この前代未聞の態度は当然自国民全体から非難、排斥されるべきだし、発言の意図を推察すればロシアとの癒着と蜜月的関係は明らかなので、ロシアへの機密情報漏洩という罪状だって冤罪ではなく真実だと簡単に確信できる。<br>　その場合は国家的な犯罪に手を染めている人物があろうことか大統領選に再出馬するという国家的な恥辱を各国にさらすことになるので、ザユナイテッドステイツオブアメリカの司法の最高機関（最高裁判所）は<br>勇気を持った決意ある判断を国民の総意の力を借りて下すべきだ。<br>その英断の名は有罪だ。<br><br>Please  transrate in English
3213,This is what Trump meant when he said “Bloodbath” lol
3214,Biden cant evag walk damass
3215,The mediators are too rich to go grocery shopping. If it was up by $20 overall then it’s normal inflation. It’s doubled. Everyone here is a joke. Isn’t it suppose to be a top job? We have such talented people in America and nobody else wants this job ?
3216,Indians thinking about Modiji and Rahul Gandhi😂
3217,Biden:<br>O_o
3218,Why do people keep saying Biden&#39;s mental health is deteriorating? Wasn&#39;t he always like this?
3219,manchurian candiddate 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3220,2 clowns 🤡
3221,Trump who really loves America and American people should be next President in America.
3222,"Ok, guys, the joke isn&#39;t funny anymore.  Who are the real presidential candidates?"
3223,im sick of hearing the word&quot; the idea&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3224,They both lie but almost everything out of Bidens mouth was an easily verifiable lie with simple google searches on his claims.
3225,"Let me put it in a different and more easily understandable way... There was a time in the US where moderate Republicans and Democrats shared common interests together, despite their political and ideological differences. It is THAT order which Trump and his cult followers have shaken up since 2016, followed by the Biden counter-block now which isn&#39;t any better either. It&#39;s bad for the peace of both sides, since they are being taken over by the extreme fringes on either side now, as I said. And this will only create more division domestically.<br><br>By the way, here in Europe and especially in Germany we have experiences over many decades with left-wing and right-wing radicals always at each other&#39;s throats, since neither of them will ever compromise to the other extreme. Hence they are not solving any problems, only creating more chaos. That&#39;s why we have additional political parties in the center in Europe who can tame both sides and introduce common ground and consensus in a professional manner accepted by everyone. They say Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy were such Presidents, to name some American equivalents in history. Bringing lefties and righties together has never been easy though. It&#39;s like mixing salt and sugar. But it can taste good if done correctly!"
3226,I don’t understand what this dude is talking Jesus ( Biden just stop 😅)
3227,"I&#39;m a single white mom, I work full time, no government benefits and I can&#39;t afford to sew a Dr because of copays, my grocery bill, rent has all went up."
3228,"The limited two-party system in tne US now shows its design flaws and vulnerabilities. If you can only have the communist far-left (controlling Biden) or the fascist far-right (acting behind Trump) rule a country now then neither outcome will be beneficial for the majority of people, unless you directly belong to one of the extreme fringes or hold some prestige or power position there. Whether you accept it or not, depending which side you root for, this is the political reality in the US today."
3229,"this debate is rigged. The panel gives Biden the time to respond, but they never give that time to Trump to respond it is always a new question to Trump."
3230,Trump 2024
3231,Ukraine  should not be NATO period!!!!!
3232,This debate was like watching a Lion (Trump) vs a baby gazelle (Biden).
3233,&quot;jobs for Americans from all over the world??&quot; hey joe you have shown  we can&#39;t be trusted
3234,"Poetin wants peace. He was put with his back against the wall with Ukraïne, NATO could come way to close to Russian borders, and also he is protecting those in Ukraïne that are under threat of the other parties in Ukraïne. Both Trump and Biden do not seem to know what is really going on, and I can&#39;t take either seriously."
3235,opoid?/  that due to open borders caused by bidden
3236,I love the way western government run their elections
3237,You have the morals of an alley cat😢😂
3238,Bring back Bernie Saunders!!!!
3239,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1345"">22:25</a> did he call him Brandon 🤣"
3240,But Trump is clearly lying!
3241,Why was a teleprompter allowed
3242,Actually when you listen to Biden yet again..he didn&#39;t perform as badly as some in the comment section put it.
3243,Is this American Got Talents?
3244,They just caught an illegal MS13 terrorist in Maryland last week.
3245,Did anyone see the mediator&#39;s face when President Biden said&quot; Something snapped in you when you lost the last time&quot; and Mr. Trump was smiling? She looked she was fighting hold back laughter. I wondered how on earth those two mediators found the power to maintain their composure through all of this. That&#39;s the resolve America needs to be great.🎉
3246,Dynamic Don vs Sleepy Joe
3247,"President Biden is suffering from something.  You can see it just in the first few minutes of the debate compared to before.<br><br>I am not a doctor, but I know what that looks like.  <br><br>Does it mean he is suffering from Parkinson’s?  Not necessarily.<br><br>There are a lot of things that can look like Parkinson’s.<br><br>Does it mean he needs to be looked at and monitored?  Yes.<br><br>He could just be sick with something. I don’t know because I haven’t watched him over the years.<br><br>People would have to watch him over the next debates and his daily interactions.  You don’t know what he’s dealing with. There might be other forces at play that we just don’t know about.<br><br>I will say this:  I know Exactly what that looks like to me- but again, I am no doctor and I don’t watch the news or TV very much at all.<br><br>The only way to truly know is for him to take levodopa carbidopa and watch what happens.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>- I will say this- if he decides to run again, his aides, his top advisors, and any professors that are in his confidence will be more pronounced, as they Should be anyway.<br>- If he is suffering in silence, you would see (effectively) mostly just his Aides and professors, which ultimately you have to decide if that’s a good or bad thing.<br>- he needs to stay active in order to not get locked up, if it is the case.  He would need therapy (physical, occupational and linguistically) daily, and constant interaction.<br><br>For any person suffering from it, what matters is having meaning and seeing the people that matter most to you.<br>- Other presidents suffered mightily from other neurological diseases with the help of aides and Advisors, Besides their own Vice President."
3248,Trump 2024 🎉🎉🎉
3249,Bring Obama back! Simple..
3250,"As a Veteran, the ability to have the choice to see non-VA care provider when the wait to see a VA care provider is too long was important. These were special circumstances, but important.<br>Now, the VA has been instructed to stop allowing Veterans the choice to be seen by non-VA providers."

3254,Gooooo trump we love you.
3255,Biden looks scary.
3256,Yah we need it cause of all your failures. Biden.
3257,A acutely feel bad for Biden the people pushing him toward need to have a word with them selves seriously 👀 at him it’s over
3258,"N0 this is the worst. Shape we have ever been in, they trust you?? He has lost. It."
3259,"As an international observer and democrat myself I pity Americans in 2024. They have the worst choice to make this year in any presidential election. Mad Trump or Sleepy Joe... Needless to say, you will only be satisified if you belong to the political hardcore base of any of the two candidates, while ignoring the other half 50% of the country. For everyone else in the middle neither choice will do. Meaning right-wing conservatives will love Trump while left-wing progressives will totally be devastated. And the other way round if JB was to be reelected. This will further divide the US domestically, any direction this goes."
3260,"Trumps the best, president. In all history. We love trump.."
3261,"Theres the proof ask the people, then the will tell you..."
3262,"Yah the worst is you. How come he has all the supporters, then. You got none😂😂😂"
3263,Yep
3264,He is so twisted.
3265,He&#39;s smokin biden.
3266,Sure looks like he is listening to someone. With ear phones.
3267,"What have you done? Nothing but destroy our country,"
3268,Omg pitiful.
3269,Sleepy Joe lost that debate all he was trying to do was irritate Trump and get him going and it didn’t work
3270,Biden looks as if he&#39;s seeing the Grim Reaper staying in the corner of the room when he looks up
3271,"CNN have really shown this time how politically ideological they have become over the years and won&#39;t accept any criticism of Joe Biden. The proof is right in front of everyone&#39;s eyes. WSJ and other media outlets allow comments on the presidential debates, even Fox News, but only CNN have closed the comment section from the getgo, which is very unusual for them since they always allow commenting on any topic imaginable out there."
3272,"I’m on Social Security we can barely get by why don’t we cut your wages? Why should you get paid so much more money and live in mansions by the rest of us especially veterans our veterans should be living like Kings and Queens not people like President Biden they should cut their wages and live like we do, lower class part of the rich why don’t you pay more money your pocket? Biden you’re one of the rich you’re not paying more taxes."
3273,"I’m on Social Security we can barely get by why don’t we cut your wages? Why should you get paid so much more money and live in mansions by the rest of us especially veterans our veterans should be living like Kings and Queens not people like President Biden they should cut their wages and live like we do, lower class part of the rich why don’t you pay more money your pocket?"
3274,Food prices and living expenses is up over probably 500% because he’s in office Biden
3275,He’s speaking like an American would speak their opinion and their truth not sugarcoating everything like Biden is doing
3276,"Episode: Dr. Phil: Inside China&#39;s Secret Plan To Control America <br>This is a must watch, EVERYONE!!!! Highly important information for us all!!! Please watch"
3277,this isnt about how terribly performed they did in debate<br>it is about as an american you have only these 2 options - a childish criminal or a walking corpse
3278,I’m sorry that I’m not enjoying this debate and Biden is not convincing me. He is good for this country. Trump was president. We could afford to live people like me that are in the lower class can barely buy food. What is Buy gonna do to fix that get rid of us make us sleep in homeless shelters tents on the streets where they all live in their mansions and I think about the lower class people and making them for things like food and housing. Everything is out of control. I’m pretty sure people are living in the streets. The Democrats are gonna be living in their mansions.
3279,Biden is probably planning to try to win the presidency only to hand over the presidency to Kamala after a month or so...... like his original plan until someone confronted him about his plans!
3280,I’m sorry that I’m not enjoying this debate and Biden is not convincing me. He is good for this country. Trump was president.

3281,Why does Biden keep on slandering Trump? He’s not talking about how to fix the problem. All he is doing is slandering without proof and facts. He’s not doing anything to show how to fix it or say things to Fix it. I don’t think he knows where he’s at.
3282,Why does Biden keep on slandering Trump? He’s not talking about how to fix the problem. All he is doing is slandering without proof and facts. He’s not doing anything to show how to fix it or say things to Fix it. I don’t think he knows where he’s at.

3284,Love you trump
3285,Trump ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
3286,"for around 250 years until somebody changed the laws, yet biden claims because something has been the law for 51 years makes it a good thing.<br>it should be that trump should have said &quot;i will use the same tools that the democrats have made and used, if its good for the goose its good for the gander&quot;"
3287,This like a Netflix episode get da popcorn rdy🍿
3288,"In the bible its up to the father to decide if he wants the baby. If not, the baby is left outside to fend for itself."

3299,Trump 💪
3300,Demoncrats are something else😅
3301,"I pity you all in the USA if this is your choice,tragic,and sad too"
3302,"One thing is for sure Trump was correct in that most of the world do not respect or look up to America anymore. The seriousness of the problems will take more effort than Biden or his followers can stomach. If they think Jan 6th was bad, wait till they start getting xenophobic attacks. Take it from us that know. Gov can play all the dirty tricks to stay in power until the people just had enough."
3303,"Poor Biden, his face touched my heart. please vote for Biden!! He’s the best"
3304,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2767"">46:07</a> here he actually talks coherently without stuttering or pausing for a good while, almost like being utterly offended is what woke him up lol"
3305,"Americans, uhm... Don’t you have... Uhhh... ANY OTHER PARTIES??"
3306,so American elections are about Dumb vs Dumber presidents. lol
3307,god we&#39;re so cooked
3308,the world is falling apart because of democracy.
3309,"Seriously I woke up depressed and began to read the comments here now I&#39;m having abdominal aches of laughing so much nonstop, thanks y&#39;all!"
3310,The questions aren&#39;t getting answered. Trump has to respond to the ridiculous claims and gets no time to answer questions.
3311,Wake up Joe!!! M.f
3312,"He will not block the pill. If 90 percent of all ab&#39;s are done with the pill,  what&#39;s the problem?"
3313,Biden doesn&#39;t even look like he&#39;s focused. He&#39;s day dreaming and confused
3314,Trump save the world! 2024
3315,"Trump is like SeaBiscuit. <br>He’s banged up a little, but in the end he shows you what he’s made of. A winner."
3316,"Some said Trump was running on the ceiling and spitting, Biden was crawling on the floor and peeing.<br>                                     But in fact, two pensioners are talking about something.<br>                     It would be nice for them to sit next to each other on a bench and gossip."
3317,my favorite part was watching whoever wasn’t talking. i got a good laugh out of the facial expressions

3329,We’re cooked
3330,"Both Biden and Trump are horrible options for the president and I&#39;m disappointed in and afraid for this country that these 2 have managed to get this far, Joe Biden isn&#39;t all there and Trump is being charged for dubious activities"

3357,"To be honest Illegal immigration’s impact will blow the fan when in November the package for free hotel and food expires. Biden closed pipeline for energy security, he gave 200 billion to corrupt Zelensky and especially did nothing about crime and homeless people. About inflation is not just 20% in four years, it’s over 120 %. <br>Millions of citizens are in food stamps.<br>Biden has to be replaced as he has cognitive dissonance and couldn’t speak well.<br>Technically he lost what he was speaking over 14 times in this debate"
3358,Biden may be the first president in history with plausible deniability. <br><br>The reason he looks so dumbfounded every time Trump speaks is because this is quite literally the first time he&#39;s hearing any of this information. All he has to go by is what&#39;s drip-fed to him by his personal handlers. They keep him in a bubble of lies and misinformation.
3359,Biden face be like.🥴

3361,Trump is HILARIOUS 😂
3362,If you think all of this foolishness was going on under Trump&#39;s watch then you simply don&#39;t pay attention to your surroundings. The proof is also right in front of your eyes here when you look at Biden make his silly faces and listen the responses coming out of his mouth 😂
3363,MEDIA OF AMERICA MAKING MONEY. MONEY TALKS BECOME SILENT.
3364,"No inflation?! Before Biden came into office, my family would&#39;ve been able to qualify to purchase home ( however, being active duty military at the time we didn&#39;t) ... Now!? (Now that I&#39;ve been retired?) At this rate under Biden, I will be at retiring age before i could come close to qualifying for purchasing a home ... 😤"

Biden also reminds me of the meme &quot;When you had a dream and the dream and you had a dream that you&quot;"

3410,We’re also in a situation where!!
3411,MAGACNN will not tell you but I will. At the debate the questions were changed at the last minute. Biden was never told but  Trump knew the answers because he knew it was happening. This would throw off anyone&#39;s game plan for a debate. Cnn CEO is one of the mega donors for the Trump campaign.
3412,These two both need to retire instead of squabling on public TV
3413,The idea …. The idea …… the idea …….<br><br>Joe this is the first time you’ve had ANY idea
3414,"Sorry to say, but my bank account had more money in it when Trump was in office. Biden, I&#39;m struggling to keep money in my account. That says something to me. Gas went back up the first week,  Biden took office."
3415,"It is really funny, how they call each other: <br>“ This guy “."
3416,This is dull
3417,Biden is showing characteristics similar to my mother who had dementia
3418,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1421"">23:41</a> that is not a presidential look😂"
3419,THE IDEA
3420,"Biden had over 1 week to prepare for this, what&#39;s more: HE set all the parameters of the debate (who would do it, who could participate (not RFK Jr), how long to respond, 2 breaks (never in past presidential debates) &amp; HE KNEW ALL THE QUESTIONS BEFOREHAND!!! Plus he was obviously medicated &amp; REFUSED TO TAKE A DRUG TEST BEFORE THE DEBATE. In my opinion he did very well (just like his wife said in the tone you&#39;d use for a 3 year old), the best he could. I&#39;m talking about his performance only - not his policies - which are clearly meant to destroy the USA (good follower of the WEF anti-USA &amp; anti-human agenda). I think Trump could have performed better by being more specific about the economy &amp; his accomplishments. In fact, I don&#39;t understand what the left thinks Trump lied about?? I didn&#39;t hear any lies from Trump, but I did from Biden. Anyone surprised by Biden&#39;s demeanor and behavior has clearly been watching the wrong media - it&#39;s been abundantly documented for YEARS. Ask yourslef if you need a new news source because you are not getting the truth. Strangest comment: Biden saying women (need abortion) bc of being raped by their &quot;in laws and sisters!&quot;  Sure, that happens in HIS family (showers with 12 year old Ashley), but thankfully few people can relate to that. Biden looks like he had a stroke; when he smiled 1/2 his face was paralyzed but no one mentions that."
3421,Let&#39;s go Brandon
3422,Joe Biden parece un robot.
3423,😂 anyways I like trump. <br>His audacity is second to none

3426,Go Biden 💙
3427,Trump speak loud and clear. Biden can&#39;t explain anything. I dont understand him. Make trump win and let him stop the war. Make the world great again

3453,"Format: Trump lies, Biden protests it, CNN says, “Ok, thank you President Biden!”"
3454,I don&#39;t think Biden helped his campaign.
3455,15 minutes in when Trump said the vote is up to the people on that topic. Biden shakes his head
3456,"After watching a second time, I think POTUS BIDEN will be our finest president ever!"
3457,Good luck  Americans😂
3458,"Seems like the only thing Biden could do is use fake quotes that make Trump look bad when he wasn&#39;t mumbling and rambling.  Trump said this, Trump said that.  All lies.  Why would the moderators only allow Biden time to respond and never allow Trump to respond to the lies Biden was saying about Trump? This was sad to watch, how can anyone take Biden seriously?"
3459,Trump also had teams of people at NY trial claiming NYC is corrupt! So what that 19 people say you didn’t say it!
3460,"How can Tapper and Bash allow Trump to call Biden a liar without reminding Trump of his 30,000+ lies he told in first term?"

3489,Trump shook his head to turning civil rights over to the states! Wasn’t that called the Confederacy?
3490,"Even though, I’m not a US citizen <br>And I have no right to say anything <br>But mr biden is a joke and have no idea what he’s talking about seriously I can’t believe how Americans vote for him honestly. I used to be a student back in the days in the states, and I love this country but what I don’t like is how the system run seems to me like personal issues comes all together against the country itself. Good luck Americans I hope this time you guys make a right decision and choose mr trump ✋"
3491,"Lying, lying, lying! And people still want him in charge! A lying narcissist, and you people think he’s better!"
3492,Someone is speaking to biden and in his ear. Watch him  he&#39;s listening

3511,"love the exchange of insult. best comedy movie. There is nothing better than watching old men exchange insults hhh. Regardless of the nonsense. With Biden health and aging man, I still would not vote for Trump. Trump is not a good choice for America. He&#39;ll bring more problems than solutions."
3512,Biden too old for this job. Trump is totally mocking this guy.
3513,President Biden clearly won this debate. President Biden had specific answers to specific questions. President Trump was not specific with his answers to questions and seemed to evade the questions. There&#39;s nothing wrong with President Biden cognitively.
3514,"Populism. Always blame on immigrants or the colored. Here, &quot;migrants.&quot; Never touch on the fundamental cause."
3515,"The people of this country should let both of these men retire and spend their old age relaxing with their family in their final years, NOT trying to run a country. This responsibility is too much for these guys. People in America are not being kind to continue voting for, endorsing and pushing these elderly men who are obviously tired, to run an entire country. Please people help figure out a way to pick two other people: N. Haley vs K. Harris? <br>Let these men rest"

3517,Something is wrong in this debate i keep ended up here😅
3518,"I know what Biden is doing I saw it in 2016 in my country. He plays the victim and can emotionally influence the electorate. If Trump tries to humiliate him, he will lose sympathy. People sympathize with the wounded, not with the tricksters. So regardless of whether it&#39;s natural or fake, Biden can win if Trump doesn&#39;t stop humiliating his opponent. He didn&#39;t and I hope he will not, he is a smart guy."
3519,I activated subtitles and it can&#39;t recognise when biden speaks😩😩😔
3520,What a time to be fluent in English meus Amigos 😂😂😂😂 what a time 😂
3521,AMERICA is a large Democratic country and PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE is a charm. We LOVE USA.💛❤💚
3522,USA needs two other candidates in the race
3523,"Trump won, that&#39;s clear,but his position about war in Ukraine is too naive, i mean there&#39;s no way that putin and zele will make peace. You need to choose Rus or Ukr, that&#39;s all. And Biden in that spectacular moment was right when he said politics doesn&#39;t work like that."
3524,bring back Regan even though he is dead
3525,What Lala land does Biden and his staff live in? We aren’t senile like him and we remember how good things were under the Trump Administration and how bad things have been under Biden the last 4 years!
3526,I enjoyed that debate. Trump did way more better than he did 2020 and 2016
3527,Biden is shot 😆 trump the og

3541,Hello I am here how are you
3542,He&#39;s not going to cut social security. That&#39;s what every Democrat says to keep themselves in office.
3543,And there&#39;s no such thing as climate change
3544,"I can&#39;t believe your best argument is that Biden appears weak and confused, stumbling over his words and losing his train of thought. In comparison, Trump is a far superior president. He lost the battle within 9 mins of him chatting."
3545,The Waffle House has found it’s new host
3546,Just imagine if there was a live audience during the debate ? Joe wouldve walked hand waving towards them mid way thru the debate Recognising some Dead ppl amongst the audience 😂😂
3547,Trump ✅
3548,Most stupid are those who will vote Trump!😠<br>But i dont mean Biden...😖<br>Make it Michelle Obama instead🤗<br>Or somebody else that has a good heart...
3549,Biden resting face is traumatizing 😟
3550,Are they the only options available?
3551,I feel sorry for Biden. It&#39;s sad when people make fun of him. He&#39;s an old man and needs a retirement. I hope USA will have better candidates after 4 years.
3552,Granny vs Annoying orange
3553,Biden putting up big lies to begin the debate.
3554,"Poor cnn, the only time they get ratings is watching the guy they&#39;ve been lying about and support for years get absolutely lambasted 😂"
3555,"Oh man...  With those two options, I can only imagine how hard this must be on the voter. Those parties can&#39;t be serious"
3556,"There were some moments where Biden definitely botched some things up. However, you may say I am in denial, but I still will be voting Blue, because I support Biden, the Democrats, and what they stand for and embody. If there were another choice, perhaps I wouldn&#39;t vote Blue, but truth is I only have two options.<br><br>Trump may be more articulate than Biden, and slightly better at talking, but I will not vote for him, because I vote based on ideas. Biden and the Dems have better ideas than Trump.<br><br>It is a shame to watch two grown, old men bicker back and forth and hurl insults."
3557,we are cooked🙁
3558,Trump Tells Truth ❤
3559,We were better off with Trump before Biden injected his corrupt self
3560,Just gonna listen to this on the way home and NOT look at the comments.<br><br>Just gonna add that your vote doesn’t matter. Look into divide and conquer strategy. Ok bye.
3561,Trump🎉🎉🎉🎉
3562,TRUMP 2024 .
3563,Trump : liar
3564,"pfff.. is it me or Trump does not answer straight and clear with proposals and direction to any single question? all I hear from him is no data backed up sentences and he just keeps using his time to attack the opponent. I mean, I am already amazed that someone with criminal  harges can be running for President but still, if you really are running, wouldn’t it be wise to make with a worked and defined program?"

And these are the two elderly clowns that run for the president of one of the most &quot;powerful&quot; countries in the world. Yeah. We&#39;re screwed."

3597,How can this be valid tho if Trump is a registered liar
3598,"I&#39;m 14, whoever gets elected will be my last childhood president 💀"
3599,Why don&#39;t they just answer the questions straight? I thought these people are Americans?
3600,President Biden might not be able to have more voice  when he speaks in the near future if that is his highest vocal voice.
3601,which country does biden think is the greatest economy?<br>also Biden is president so is he saying he made sure America isn&#39;t the greatest economy?
3602,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=2880"">48:00</a> is scary. They have more lined up to ensure he&#39;s going to jail because he&#39;s running for president."
3603,Why CNN didn’t insist on the question if they will recognise PALESTINE 🇵🇸 as a state? 😡
3604,Can anyone give reasoning with actual facts of why trump is/was a bad president.
3605,"This is really sad,  Biden is absolutely in no condition to run anything 😢  not even today, let alone another 4 years !<br><br>Almost appears as elder abuse !<br><br>He should be retired to enjoy what time he has left in peace , without all this stress and expectations, he seems to be forced  to follow."
3606,Trump; &quot;this war should never been started&quot;.. I would say CORRECT!
3607,"For those of you reading this comment, it&#39;s okay, it&#39;s normal to feel lonely sometimes, if you&#39;re going through tough times, keep trying, but never give up,"

3612,what a joke
3613,GROAN  The childish name calling by Biden.  This is an utter embarrassment.  The facilitators did a good job.
3614,"Listen to The Real Debate, where Robert Francis Kennedy Jr- independent candidate for 2024 elections, responds to the two who CNN hosted, and presents his solutions.<br><br>RFK jnr is the nephew of JF Kennedy, who was president in the 50s and 60s. <br>Check out The Real Debate to see him in the debate alongside Trump and Biden, using the Internet tech to skip over CNN and the two parties trying to exclude him, smear him, and pretend he doesn&#39;t exist. <br><br>He was the best debater by far, actually having intelligent solutions about the real issues we are facing. For example - Americans have had a 22 percent hike in home insurance and are paying $4 for a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread and $6 for a gallon of gas, then he added: &quot;It&#39;s because of the forever wars and out-of-control spending by these two gentlemen ... this is the reason they need me on stage, because I will confront them with what they did.&quot;<br>See for yourself - <br><a href=""https://www.kennedy24.com/the-real-debate"">https://www.kennedy24.com/the-real-debate</a>"
3615,"In all seriousness, Bidens&#39; face shows how really confused and clueless he is. As a healthcare provider, it&#39;s easy to call out Dementia and cognitive decline just by looking at him"
3616,"In France, the leftists have won the legislative elections. The country is doomed. Same in UK.<br>Please USA, don&#39;t follow the same path."
3617,How trump kept a straight face is beyond me.  I would&#39;ve been on the floor dying laughing

3641,That&#39;s my Joe. Created chaos and claimed to Trump. Never accepted anything wrong or regretted any mistakes.

3646,BIDEN IS SO COOKED 💀 Trump 2024

3666,"The last bit- Trump hit the nail on the head.<br>Putin didn&#39;t take land under Trump. He took land under Bush, Obama and Biden.<br>Weak men aren&#39;t feared. Biden is a weak man."
3667,Trump is right. WE pay for the worlds woes. We pay for everything when others get to pay nothing or next to nothing.
3668,"Biden couldn’t even pronounce the name of one of the main cities in the Ukraine war, Kyiv, the capital. He must not actually care."
3669,Biden is a war criminal
3670,From what I seen while trump was president everywhere I looked folks were building and having new and more ways to get money. While Biden been president I see inflation and illegal immigrants getting everything.
3671,Glad to see Trump will be in the oval office again.
3672,Don&#39;t believe your own eye&#39;s
3673,=))) it seem that biden want to put all of the wrong to trump&#39;s head
3674,Biden choked along with his watching voters.
3675,"I have a really hard time listening to Biden, not because what he says, more about how he is talking. Im always afraid hes gonna lose his point and waste my time listening"
3676,"sorry, i just can’t vote for any person (male or female) who can’t speak coherent English"

3680,"Breathe, Joe, breathe, don&#39;t die yet.  You can kick the bucket after you lose the election."
3681,I think mr. biden watches his favorite clint eastwood movies on the daily
3682,Technically it’s the 44th and 45th president of the United States. Still surprises me that the official documents are still wrong on this.
3683,"Biden said around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1575"">26:15</a> that he spoke with &quot;all those heroes that died&quot; at the D-Day memorial 😂"

3686,"Biden&#39;s mouth going to fast for his brain.  Biden looks like somebody just stole his puppy.  Biden squeaking again wake up Joe.  Biden mumble, mumble, mumble.  Biden is super generous with my tax dollars.   All the constitutional lawyers on youtube said the case should never have been brought and after it was brought they all said the case should be dropped, and they all said how can you convict someone without a unanimous decision.  the judge told the jury you don&#39;t need a unanimous decision to convict him."

President Joe Biden said in present debate as he is running for President now  that a number of Republicans want to end Social Security.

3787,"I think many people know it by now. The people who are in control are so far from our sight, and these are two actors auditioning for the same part . Do you really think Biden was running your country? He can barely speak.  But not just the USA ,the puppets whom we know as presidents and leaders , they do what they told to do . Patterns are too familiar everywhere . I can prove it, but you already know it . If you don&#39;t, you never will , accepting this matter is not the point , thinking is."

I was a lower income lower class if you would like to call it that that because of Trump and his policies and because of the economy during his presidency, my life had, a hopeful and pleasant future ahead of me. Once he came into office, Biden stripped me of everything I ever had. I lost everything because of his policies I was literally homeless. I can’t afford to feed my family. I have to work three jobs just to make ends meet Biden is the worst president I have ever experienced during my lifetime, I believe that he is for himself that he is selfish that he is a scared wussy baby that he is incompetent and that he needs to go. I want Trump back because my life was awesome when he was president and I’m coming from the lower end of society that had a chance to make it in this world Because of Biden, I’m hopeless. <br>Bring Trump back!!!!!"

3922,"The Trump presidency was making America stronger, jobs and economy were steadily improving for the first three years. He did have a tendency to say whatever was on his mind when he shouldn’t have spoke so impulsively. But  even his ridiculous comments weren’t as embarrassing to this country has the things Biden says. We didn’t look weak in the eyes of the world like we do now! And Trump certainly didn’t even come close to running  up the deficit spending that the current administration has. Covid crashed the economy here just as it did in countries all across the world. The over the top scare tactics and ridiculous mandates with the closures of businesses shut our economy down. Not Trump!!!!"

I realized that Democrats will never watch anything considered wrong and harmful and do nothing about it.  America, you are that father who was given a duty to look after the entire family.  Unfortunately,  you made so many mistakes that you need to try and fix. All you need to do is find better and peaceful ways to fix the broken pieces of your family.

I’m not a millionaire by any stretch of the imagination.  I do see illegal immigrants being dropped off at my small town train station because Chicago refuses to take anyone else.  Who’s that helping?  Dropping a bunch of folks who don’t have money, family or any resources off at a train station in the middle of no where with a train ticket going somewhere else.  I feel sorry for these folks.  They ain’t got nothing and have been promised the world and get dumped off to fend for themselves.  Why bring them in?"

This one is not fit. They usually arent.<br><br>There should be an age limit for presidents.<br>Im an old geezer and Its just common sense.<br>At least Biden will have people to guide him. Trump will just have other criminals saying <br>&quot;Yes Boss!&quot;<br><br>The Joker is, of course, unacceptable in any circumstance. He is a fascist and dangerous.<br><br>The fighting between each other has been ignited intentionally.

4037,What a complete and unmitigated disaster.
4038,I commend Biden for not pooping his pause and remaining alert and coherent for in his case guiness world record 60 minutes straight
4039,"If you don&#39;t want to vote for Biden because of his age, just imagine he&#39;s a zombie. A zombie president--now that&#39;s pretty frigging cool."
4040,CNN sucks and is a terrible news agency. Trying to monopolize the airing of the Presidential debate with bribes and threats. I spit on the trepidation you spill on to society.

4053,Every time biden says &quot;The idea&quot; i get the nick fury feel😂
4054,Ok
4055,"It isn’t a sin to become older and not be as sharp as one once was.  Biden is showing obvious signs of aging, losing his train of thought, stumbling and looking confused and lost, etc.… that happens to all of us… but he is the leader of our Country… we can’t afford to have a person leading our Country that is suffering with a mental decline occurring. I have no respect for Jill Biden who would insist that he’s fit to serve.  If she loves him, she should do the right thing which would be to encourage him to hand over the torch.  Everyone, including other leaders can see for themselves… I will admit the choice we have is tough, but Biden is struggling more and more.  It’s like he is trying to prove something.  He needs to step down while he still has respect from the people."

4182,"Hitler and Trump similarities:<br><br>Use of Propaganda:<br><br>Hitler: Utilized propaganda extensively to spread Nazi ideology, control public perception, and demonize opponents. Joseph Goebbels, his Minister of Propaganda, played a key role in this.<br><br>Trump: Frequently used social media and rallies to communicate directly with his base, often bypassing traditional media. He also labeled mainstream media as &quot;fake news&quot; to undermine their credibility.<br><br>Populist Rhetoric:<br><br>Hitler: Promoted a nationalist agenda, blaming Jews and other minorities for Germany&#39;s problems and promising to restore Germany to its former glory.<br><br>Trump: Used populist themes, emphasizing &quot;America First,&quot; and often blamed immigrants, foreign nations, and political elites for America&#39;s issues.<br><br>Charismatic Leadership:<br><br>Hitler: Cultivated a strong, authoritative image, presenting himself as the savior of Germany.<br><br>Trump: Presented himself as a strong leader who could fix the country’s problems, often portraying himself as an outsider fighting against a corrupt establishment.<br><br>Scapegoating:<br><br>Hitler: Blamed Jews, communists, and other groups for Germany&#39;s economic and social woes, leading to severe persecution.<br><br>Trump: Frequently blamed immigrants, particularly from Mexico and Muslim-majority countries, as well as political opponents for various issues facing the United States.<br><br>Rallying Support through Mass Gatherings:<br><br>Hitler: Organized large rallies, such as those in Nuremberg, to energize his supporters and project power.<br><br>Trump: Held frequent rallies across the country to maintain enthusiasm among his base and project strength.<br><br>Disdain for Democratic Norms:<br><br>Hitler: Exploited the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic’s democratic system to gain power and ultimately dismantle it.<br><br>Trump: Criticized various democratic institutions and norms, including questioning the legitimacy of elections and the integrity of the judicial system"
4183,Biden and his administration is pure evil.  They should all be locked up.  Pathetic.

4293,"I like the ad pauses, Joe has that open mouth and thousand yard stare he&#39;s known for"
4294,"Question # 1 of the debate was about inflation.<br><br>The very first words out of Biden&#39;s mouth were lies....<br><br>1). &quot;Well, You got to take a look at what I was left when I became President. What Mr. Trump left me.&quot;<br><br>Fake! The condition of the economy was not due to Trump, but due to the pandemic and due to Governor&#39;s who mandated the closing of businesses in their states. He was not responsible for that condition other than to say it would have been worse had he not done the things he did. &quot;What Mr. Trump left me&quot; suggests that what was left was of his doing and it absolutely was not.<br><br>2). &quot;We had an economy that was in free fall&quot;<br><br>Lie - people were starting to get vaccines in December and things were  already rapidly returning to normal by late January. Things weren&#39;t falling, they were rising.<br><br>3). &quot;The pandemic was so badly handled, many people were dying and all he said was &#39;it&#39;s not that serious, just inject a little bleach into your arm you&#39;ll be alright.&quot;<br><br>Objectively-Lie, Lie, Lie<br>A. The pandemic wasn&#39;t mishandled. They did try their best, supplying the CDC with the resources to do it&#39;s work. Doctors, not politicians lead the response. If social distancing and masking were not effective I wouldn&#39;t blame the administration or even the medical scientists who were limited in what could be done. There was no great silver bullet they missed. A great and effective grand thing that would make all the difference. It was small things that had small impacts.<br><br>B. Many people were dying, that&#39;s true. But anything that comes after the statement of &quot;all he said&quot; would be a deliberate misrepresentation unless it contained ALL of what he said.<br><br>C. The statement he attributed to him was nothing even remotely close to what he said... and it wasn&#39;t even based on something he said. It was based on a question he asked someone while not addressing the press. Something he found interesting. That statement was a complete lie and deliberately misleading anyone who heard it. Trump never even used the word bleach. He did use the word disinfectant. A person with a virus is infected. To disinfect a person infected with a virus is to inject an antiviral medication. A virus killer. Antivirus is a disinfectant because it comes in contact with a virus and the virus dies. Antibodies attack infections. The therapy monoclonal antibodies used man made proteins that acted like antibodies in that they bound to the virus and destroyed it. As they disinfected an infected person, and it was an IV injection, they actually did inject people with a type of disinfectant.<br><br>4. &quot;The economy collapsed. There were no jobs&quot;<br><br>Absolutely FALSE!!! Businesses couldn&#39;t hire because no one wanted to work. Businesses had to struggle to get staff to return as he was taking office. TONS of jobs, no people.<br><br>5. &quot;The unemployment rate rose to 15%&quot;<br><br>Lie.... he asked us to look at what he left us. Joe took office late January of 2021, did he not? The month of January 2021 had a 6.3% unemployment rate and was coming down nearly half a percent (.4%). Not as bad as Joe states it and improving. The rebound had begun. The difference between 6.3% and 15% is HUGE!!! Double the 6.3 to 12.6% and you are still way off by thousands and thousands.<br><br>If you wanna say he wanted to say that&#39;s how bad it once was, he should also give Trump credit for getting it from 15% down to 6.3%. But as you listen, the intent was to make Biden look like he was the one that conquered the 15% unemployment obstacle. No, he spent trillions taking us from 6.3 to around 4%. His goal was to make his achievement look better than it was.<br><br>* Next was some pointless words with no claims.<br><br>6. &quot;We created 15,000 new jobs&quot;<br>               😯<br>I put that face because of his next statement:<br><br>&quot;We brought out...<br>(Ahem)<br>In a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs&quot;<br><br>False. This can&#39;t be accurate... if you have 800,000 NEW manufacturing jobs, how can you have only created 15,000 jobs? Which one is false because we aren&#39;t that bad at math that we can&#39;t see one or both are fake numbers. You can&#39;t call it truth.<br><br>PS: Giving government contracts from money the government doesn&#39;t have and thus spending tomorrow&#39;s money now is robbing future tax collections. That enlarges the money supply.... that&#39;s how you caused the inflation. <br><br>He actually gave one of the answers to thr question here... we created jobs with government money. It&#39;s the people who took these jobs and spent their paychecks buying stuff that caused inflation.<br><br>Good luck in getting him to acknowledge they over stimulated the economy and that did it. He&#39;s probably not smart enough to know that."

There was no Domino Effect after we pulled out. <br>We were in Vietnam for 20 years and 58,220 US military died."
4341,I love trump 2025 all the way🦾🦾
4342,This was too obvious.
4343,Is Trump going to ever answer any of the questions asked?  He&#39;s awful.
4344,Blew up in CNN face lol
4345,"I watched the debate between Donald Trump/Biden but I have some suspicious about  control of the loud speaker who controls it, why was it very loud when Trump speaks and very fanty when Biden speaking, age is a number. Based on Donald trump&#39;s records and what he said he will do if elected, a senceable citizens must be scared of him, don&#39;t elect or vote for him."
4346,&quot;Worst president&quot; telling each other 😅
4347,Trump did awful he did not once answer the questions asked. Also what is a black job?
4348,"An A.i. running in a quantum computer will run as president in the near future. Now, the good thing about Biden winning is his Vice."
4349,"Out of over 300 million Americans, these two are the only options to run this great nation? Like seriously? Its so sad to see these clowns. When will we get a leader who wants to lead America, not Israel, not China and definitely not big pharma"
4350,American got talent golden buzzer?
4351,"Let&#39;s go, Brandon! 😮"
4352,Covid 19 hurt the economy. Shut down no jobs no income. The economy business was hurt. We as Americans hurt. As result. When economy restarted of course inflation happens to reboot economy. Job rebooted. As normal. Thank god for getting back to normal. We give the government to much credit for change or lack of. Yet we dont trust them but expect them to help us when we down. Yet some people haven&#39;t made personal changes to help themselves. Pick ur battles. The middle remain in the middle maintaining. Always takes care of each other. Trump is before and mid covid and biden is post covid. Measure the change and focus of the next 4yrs. Realistic change over depending on the wealthy to bail is out . We are the bail out. Who will make the rich pay?
4353,"Biden, as the daughter of a combat vet who died from burn pit cancer from Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, sister of a combat vet in Afghanistan, and a retired Navy vet, I can assure you, the military hates you and what your administration did to the military."
4354,Trump said 28 lies. I think biden topped that one. But trumps are lies. Bidens are mis speaks.
4355,Only thing joe cares about is taxes. It&#39;s all tax and spend. Tax and spend
4356,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=4585"">1:16:25</a> I swear trump farted or something anybody else hear it?"
4357,😦
4358,I hate CNN and I am frustrated that CNN was used for this debate. CNN is full of liars and Anti-American people. They have no ability to run an honest foot race let alone a very serious debate!
4359,I’m voting for the felon
4360,"Biden really got some problems, and he has the nuclear button"
4361,"Trump making contradictory statements about abortion and Biden mumbling, looking half dead…..are there no better options?"
4362,Why is  Biden reading from papers?  I thought  no  notes were allowed.
4363,Love❤ Trump!
4364,"Biden is thinking, man, whoever this guy is, he should be running for president the way he&#39;s staring at Trump while he answers his questions."
4365,Is it just me or is trump wearing e Toupé?
4366,Biden certainly looked old and weak but his speech was solid
4367,Trump funny 😂
4368,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1380"">23:00</a>: Millions of Trump&#39;s undocumented immigrants are native Americans who have lived in what is currently the United States for many thousands of years before Trump was born. His plan is not deportation. A lot of it is genocide and forced expatriation."
4369,Trump please comeback to White House
4370,debate had 2 e attendee . WOW january riot my staff no called to be in D.C.  Achievehids
4371,"This is peak America 😂😂😂<br><br>The entrance alone is gold.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=134"">2:14</a>"
4372,"Triumph is going to be Re-elected, if Americans have sense."
4373,"я конечно знала что Байден в возрасте, но голос у него еще старше..."
4374,Presidential debate ❎ Kids debate ✅
4375,"The REAL reason why he lost was mentioned 2 mins into the debate-- &quot;Pre written notes, props, contact with campaign staff are not permitted&quot;. The mans a puppet, not an intellectual."
4376,"I thought learning something through this political debate, instead laughed to death...  Politicians are politicians and are same everywhere."
4377,I wish Trump had said more about his tax cuts cutting EVERYONE&#39;S taxes. It raised standard deductions which puts one in a lower bracket. Lower tax brackets pay lower taxes.<br>Child tax credits
4378,У них хотя есть дебаты...
4379,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=714"">11:54</a> i skibidi wizz💀💀"
4380,YOOO THIS DEBATE IS FIREEE 🔥🔥🔥🔥 PUT IT OUT 🧯🧯🧯🧯
4381,Good Entertainment. Feels like something out of a daily SOAP
4382,"Trump is right, Biden doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s saying 😂 he&#39;s all just stuttering"
4383,The idea 😂
4384,number one: the idea...<br>number two: the idea...
4385,Is USA lack of capable candidates to president?
4386,this is your model of democracy ? choosing  between these two? I&#39;ll pass
4387,why is this the only people america can put trust in? they both kinda look ridiculous
4388,CANADA Needs TRUMP!!!! To win the Presidential Election in the USA!!!
4389,Democrats forever😅
4390,This debate made trump actually look likable and Biden look like he had a stroke; most of what biden said didn&#39;t even make sense.
4391,"it&#39;s wild biden wan&#39;ts to tax the top rich, you can&#39;t just peoples money away like that they worked for that money/life"
4392,Lol biden said the unemployment rate was 50% under trump and inflation was 0 because no one was working. Thats plain wrong and makes NO SENSE. Inflation is PURELY and ONLY from too much currency in a market. It has nothing to do with jobs
4393,"Ya Allah Azzwajal Pakistan ke tmam corrupt anaasir ko Apney mehboob bandon ke zareah kaifer kirdaar tak pohncha or Apna or Apney Mehbood Sallallahu Alaihe wasallam ka naam sarbuland farma, Aameen Sum Aameen😢😢😢😢FREE IMRAN KHAN 😢😢😢😢FREE DR. AAFIA SIDDIQUI.😢😢😢FREE ALL INNOCENT😢😢😢😢"
4394,Number 1. I think Biden has big problem staying longer than 15 minutes. Number 2. To participate in debate is a big physical challenge to him. Number 3. What drives Biden in politics is possibility to lie with no legal consequence.
4395,"This is the man dealing with putin, xi, and mbs. Yeah..."
4396,so basically we&#39;re doomed
4397,Biden is 100% delusional
4398,Biden should have retired with dignity 4 years ago. I hope they just let him go now. Pathetic.
4399,"No,  biden, Obama separated family&#39;s and children. Not trump"
4400,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=1290"">21:30</a> 😭😭"
4401,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamtrump"">#TEAMTRUMP</a>"
4402,The US literally has the greatest economy in the world 🙄 Texas’s GDP is higher than all of Russia’s
4403,Trump couldnt be more right
4404,Biden seems the same in this debate as he is in all other interview and speeches.  It’s crazy that the next interview he said he had a bad day because his team and Nancy said it he had to stand behind it. Smh. God bless us
4405,Shame on Biden and his team
4406,"I&#39;m a waitress in Canada at a diner. Most of my customers are seniors. I see alot of talk on U.S. news about Biden&#39;s age being a problem, but age is not the problem.. however if a president has dementia then this is a big problem! There&#39;s many of my senior customers who are very intelligent people. I guess I worry that people will get biased towards older people."
4407,Who’s here not an American? 🤡
4408,Why was there so much digression on the &quot;Child care&quot; and &quot;Addiction&quot; questions?
4409,Free Palestine 🇵🇸
4410,Trump 2024
4411,I thought it was so great biden thanked the audience in the studio first !!  lol
4412,"Inflation brings it from $100 to $120, corporate price gouging is what&#39;s bringing it much further up."
4413,100$ cart of groceries now cost $120?? Try over $250 where did they get that BS from?
4414,登子哥太难了哈哈哈哈
4415,"Yes Trump we did a great job, that&#39;s why our public debt is so high. Good job equals high debt."
4416,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=511"">8:31</a> Biden face😮"
4417,"Trump was speaking facts, once again. Stop letting media manipulate you. This is like hip hop vs mumble rap"
4418,Our choices for president in 2024: <br><br>1) A disrespectful old man that fuels hate and division.<br>2) An old man that has no idea where he’s at.
4419,What about CHILD CARE?!!! if neither of them have a solution for this then I’m not voting.
4420,The truth is you don&#39;t even have to watch the debate to make a decision. This is the first time in American history where a debate is irrelevant. Even Joes own party knows he can not continue to serve as president... and nobody wants him. Americans don&#39;t want him!
4421,That guy don’t even blink
4422,"Did anyone notice Dana’s eyes at trump at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=165"">2:45</a>.  😍❤!!!! Check it out and reply what you think"
4423,Trump is a liar
4424,Biden needs to win to save are country
4425,"Why are we still letting old folks lead us? Joe looks like he&#39;s about to have a seizure every time Donald speaks. We&#39;re the reason why we&#39;ll never see progress in any country. None of these presidents can ever account for their actions in 30+ years. How can we expect anything from people who are about to kick the bucket, bonkers! They busy try&#39;nna make sure their bucket list well stock before its off. Wild."
4426,this is thew worst HAHA
4427,Biden must not be DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
4428,&#39;I skibidi with&#39;
4429,What?... is going on? Is there no speech class of any kind?  pronunciation? spelling? you&#39;re telling me there was no vocal training done for Biden at all? intonation... vowel...
4430,so this is how our generation shutting down the greatest country in whole history. By watching two grandpa chatting nonsenses.
4431,"These comments tell the truth. If biden wins, something really isn&#39;t right"
4432,&quot;And by the way&quot;....😂😂😂😂😂
4433,He&#39;s a lie
4434,Biden was a fool to debate without fact checkers as trump makes up lies on the fly
4435,every decision biden makes is to our detriment .he is china&#39;s puppet .paid for.
4436,Biden looks funny
4437,👇🏻team trump
4438,my comment keeps getting erased
4439,i couldnt understand a word joe said during the entire time
4440,"I have the walmart app for my kids, I have all my order history which I usually click order again... it shows the total amount you paid for the previous orders, anyway, the same order from when we had trump was almost $250, that same order is $550 so it&#39;s gone up more than 20% with bidenomics that&#39;s all I gotta say about that"
4441,Trump: <b>starts speaking</b> <br><br><br><br><br>Biden: 😨
4442,Biden stole the election
4443,"To quote Hillary Clinton, &quot;What difference at this point does it make?&quot;"
4444,BRAVE MAN TRUMP
4445,DOESN&#39;T MATTER WHAT BIDEN MUMBLES
4446,TRUMP 2024
4447,TRUMP LOVES AMERICA  XX
4448,is biden smoking lean
4449,"This is really selfish of Joe Biden to run for elections. He definitely won’t win, why not take a step back so that a more promising candidate can represent the democrats."
4450,We are by far in worse shape than when Mr .Trump was in office. <br> Biden repeatedly lied during the entire debate. <br> If Biden wins this time it will be obvious that it was by cheating period.
4451,This video needs a fact checker
4452,Biden lies so much.
4453,Idiocracy was a prophecy.
4454,They shouldn’t have let Dana loach around she isn’t like this normally but she knows what she is doing
4455,It&#39;s crazy to see CNN host the roast the Joe biden 😮 and then for him to do impersonations of bush and Christopher Walken
4456,DJ TRUMP IS CRACKED IM THINKING 1000 YEARS
4457,It feels more like a battle between two grandpas than an presidential debate. I hope for all Americans good luck 🇺🇸🦅
4458,After watching Bidin the last 4 years I am inclined to believe that  he was in decline menaly when he was running . He never got out and campaigned he stayed in his basement . I remember thinking back then that I have never seen an election where you never saw a politician running for office out in the public&#39;s eye  as much as Joe was .
4459,America is cooked 😂
4460,Trump evaded the question on immigration. Can someone  remind him please!
4461,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=3000"">50:00</a> he ran because him and his wife have been planning on this for decades"
4462,Nice. They are fighting like street fighter just like here in India 😂
4463,😂😂😂 Biden face emoji 😂👈🏻 🤣🤣
4464,And by the way...
4465,Projection is perhaps the most important defense mechanism in politics
4466,What are “black jobs”?
4467,"As a 70-year-old woman he is correct period there were fathers in home they worked hard .Mother&#39;s cooked and cleaned and watched after their children. they helped them with homework if they could. In the worst of times They loved each other and stayed together regardless of Jim-Crow, attacks from KKK and Social norms of that time. Family church community and the future we&#39;re in our spirits and our minds and our hearts.. Then Johnson signed the welfare at knowing that it would cause internal grief and heartache. It was the divorce Of the family by the Liberal government And affected all things about the black community even to now. Add the Margaret Sanger manifesto with abortion clinics., Had the LGBTQ agenda to emmasculate  The black American Man..the Mexican drug cartels and gangs and unchecked illegal guns in the Black communities . Its the racist,liberal elitists,the wealthiest of America and George Soros political hacks and .main stream media . NOW, HERE IS DAMON SAYING EVERY THING I&#39;VE  SAID FOR 6 YEARS AND HAVE BEEN CHASTISED FOR  BY FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND ASSOCIATES FOR MY WHOLE  REPUBLICAN POLITICAL LIFE.

4474,I had to scroll down so far to find this video. I swear they don’t want people to see it.
4475,TRUMP 24 - Biden  0
4476,Trump refused to answer some very critical questions.<br><br>Trump’s definition of a “good” election is one in which he wins.
4477,skibidi
4478,Both these men need to sit down!
4479,Gosh once again in American politics people are forced to choose the lesser of two &quot;weevils&quot;. The poor country.

4488,"1st world country is a joke, greeting from a third world country"
4489,Biden keeps saying “the idea….” after every opening sentence. if only biden could have better ideas lol
4490,Americans think these old men will lead the American and retain its title of super power 😂
4491,Putting commercials before Trump every single time ... This is a joke n Joey B is embarrassing to listen too 🤦🏻‍♂️ Dont talk about peace treaty dont talk about Trump getting nominated for 2 Nobel Peace prizes... When he starts jumpin around u guys stop him 😂😂😂😂😂
4492,"Wow.. what about white child care, he is pandering to black people because no white people will vote for him."
4493,"Yeah, Biden&#39;s age is a problem. Much worse, though, is that 2/3 of Republican voters still believe they don&#39;t have a legitimately elected president. In 2024, THAT IS the problem with the United States."
4494,"Both of these men have terrible egos. With Trump it&#39;s always &quot;I did this&quot; and &quot;I did that.&quot; And it doesn&#39;t seem to matter to Biden that he may no longer be capable, all he wants is to be President"
4495,Trump: I am the best<br>Biden: I am the best of the worst
4496,Bidens got that gyatt
4497,"Hamas has 5 American hostages, Israel killed 5 British humanitarians. I wouldn’t be surprised if no hostage come back. It’s not like Israel know where their hostages are but they flatten the whole of Gaza?"

4499,Both of them will protect Israel at any cost. Are they really opposition’s?
4500,we where lied too f coved

4509,Hahahaha
4510,Good luck Trump xx
4511,My favourite part is when Biden says number one as though a second point would follow. And then it never does. At one point he had two number ones in a row 😂
4512,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=718"">11:58</a> pov: that one door when your parents are trying to sleep"

4514,One minute Biden is staring into space and the next minute he is trying to form another sentence.
4515,The amount of molarchy and lies coming out of Bidens mouth is outrageous. Their should be some sort of immediate impeachment laws put in place when the lies get to this degree. Incredible...

4520,Bye den
4521,Biden: <br>“Number 1:  the idea” <br>“Number 2: the idea” <br><br>Sums up all his responses.
4522,People be critical thinkers they sounds  like job interviews why? What if the real  leaders /power  behind is what they want us to see.. What if this is to blind us with what&#39;s real happening? Don&#39;t be deceived people time to wake up

4539,"As a Vietnam veteran, I knew the moment I heard it that that &quot;losers and suckers&quot; Trump comment supposedly made about us was pure fiction. And Trump<br>is right, I don&#39;t know a single veteran who likes Joe Biden."

4543,"Communist left or logical right, if you try to listen to this debate on medium-low, you will not be able to coherently hear what Joe Biden, the Democrat party&#39;s chosen President, is saying. This says a lot about their party throughout his entire term, a lot."
4544,I’ve see &amp; heard enough! This is the worst debate I’ve ever witnessed. naninani boo-boo! 😑
4545,Men deciding what to do with a woman’s body… 😑
4546,"It&#39;s easy to stay in power, just ask the public what they want and then deliver. It&#39;s not difficult."
4547,Even trump seems to be more concerned for Joe then  Jill and his team. Let that poor man enjoy the rest of his life instead of making him a comedic piece on national tv.

4676,I love trump&#39;s confidence
4677,Horrible Performance by the Biden Administration!!! Biden`s too old / Dementia
4678,☻️🌍
4679,It would seem Joe has amnesia regarding the THIRTEEN US military members that were blown up in Afghanistan during his disastrous pullout in 2021.
4680,"Had to come back to this today, because heard the Stephanopolis interview a few hours ago — Biden didn’t do himself any favors today. Still sounded weak, confused, angry, even a bit vindictive in mentioning Trump. Totally in denial about what the polls are showing (think WSJ has Trump up by 6 %, well beyond margin-of-error). In that respect, he was almost Trumpian, trying to present “alternative facts” that fly in the face of reality."
4681,For Hawaii 😢here’s $500.00.  “let me tell you something about me” said biden😮 nevertheless heard nothing since..
4682,To say groceries have went up 20% is laughable😂 a lot of stuff I’ve been buying literally has doubled or more since Biden took office…
4683,Trump ain’t answer no questions he just arguing these dudes venting not debating 😂
4684,Please answer the questions for God sake!! We need to know which each party will offer in change for our nation not which President is the worst every question!!

4695,Ngerti hemm❤
4696,"I hadn’t watched the full debate till just now. Gotta say I didn’t think Biden did AS bad as everyone is making it out to be. I’m 100% positive he is beyond early stages of dementia or some other cognitive issue but I was expecting far worse. Now that being said, I can only imagine what he’s going to look like in another year or two…<br><br>Trump was basically what I expected. A handful of decent talking points mixed with a mountain of hyperbole."
4697,Biden administration destroying the middle class - now we see why - he&#39;s been absent from his body this whole time
4698,"Because I am proud of the United States of America and United States of Africa remember forgotten.I help Trump in this campaign .Only the new tradition proned by Mandela isnot good.if Joe is 100years old,he can continue to stay in chief of the Un organisation.But I think that my référence Trump is reelly the best choice."

4703,We go with trump...biden is a top failure
4704,Trump is much more cognitive.
4705,I think the real question is who is really running this country? It cannot be Biden  making decisions due to his cognitive issues . <br> I suspect probably his wife.

4742,"Trump is the man we all need, biden has destroyed this great country.... The world needs Trump"
4743,"On the survey Trump was 43 rd out of 45 from worst to best. Joe has problems with communication but the survey claims he&#39;s actually doing something for the country compared to Trump. Yeah right, replace Obamas spot with Trump, Trumps spot with Biden and Biden&#39;s spot with Obama"

4753,We paid into Social Security our whole working lives. No immigrant should get a penny of it or Medicare
4754,"I think President Biden shouldn&#39;t have been allowed to engage the debate, a bit of slurred speeches. Isn&#39;t it appropriate for someone to act in his place? Not very easy being an opposition to a prospective and eloquent president like Mr. Trump. I admire the courage of Joe Biden, he stood tall with valid points in my opinion."
4755,Benjamin Netanyahu had warnings I&#39;m sure he knew something it&#39;s pretty obvious that what he is upto

4765,"What I’m seeing from Joe Biden so far after watching half of this “debate” is him mirroring Trump in the way he speaks lol… and constantly accusing him of being a liar with no real evidence to support how he’s lying…… so far this is a massive L for him. <br>Donald Trump is coming through with a far better argument even though I’m not siding with either of them because I think they’re both imbeciles in their own special way. <br>RIP America, was it nice knowing you ? No, not really but you were definitely something."
4766,President Trump all the way 2024 🇺🇸 we pray that Byedin doesnt fall victim to Killery and Obumba scary times indeed 😉

4805,The idea that joke biden is on stage debating w/ oldtimers instead of sleeping in a cellar is a bad idea.
4806,"It&#39;s funny they are asking Trump about ending political violence, when he has just been the victim of such on the highest level, as Biden has indicted him just because he is his opponent in this election. Incredible."
4807,The more CNN makes it blatantly obvious that they&#39;re hand holding Biden throughout this whole thing and still bidens falling just adds more support for Trump always remember that
4808,"YUP,YUP,YUP!!!!;Trump IS Right about all of this stuff except abortion, what woman wants there state to make her medicle decisions that should not be anyones bussiness!!

I mean, let’s pretend for a second that the phenomenon of 3rd world nations emptying their prisons into the US isn’t well documented.. it is, but let’s pretend it’s not.. WHY WOULDN’T THEY DO THAT??? Biden told the world we’d let them in with no vetting. Of course they’re going to dump vast quantities of troubled individuals into our once great nation. Leaders in those countries would be crazy not to do that."

4833,id id been Biden id have faked a medical emergency and left the debate

4837,doesn&#39;t look like Joe Biden is it really him?
4838,"Prolly the world leaders stayed at other hotel before trump hotel was built in Washington DC, needs to be looked into a little further to find these Dems owned percentages of or was investors in the hotels these leaders stayed in before Trump and this is why they are all riled up and making a big deal out of these world leaders staying in the Trump hotel because they lost money. No doubt."

4891,America&#39;s got a problem
4892,Nancy didn&#39;t think trump was that dumb to send the crowd
4893,The jar building works trumps if you remember Trump was trying to dig this out and started creating the jobs. All the first stuff that was done when Biden got in was from contracts that Trump did.
4894,Exactly the same immigration situation as the UK. Something is definitely going on. It&#39;s literally identical.
4895,The didn’t even answer the child care question…

We keep the WH  , you keep your jobs and I become the most succesful president this counttry  has ever had !  And thank your lucky stars ! &#39;&#39;"
4898,"If Biden wins again, the election is 100 per cent rigged. Im pretty sure the last one was to be honest."
4899,Joe Biden for President
4900,Is there no better candidate apart from Trump and Biden? It will be much better to engage young-minded youths in politics. 30 -60 years of age.
4901,I felt like Adam Sandler was was going to take the stage and say. &quot; Welcome to another Saturday Night alive!&quot;
4902,"The biggest thing to understand from this is that this is not a Biden issue. It is the entire Democrat party. After all, they are clearly the ones that have been driving this. Entire term into the ground. It&#39;s painfully obvious that biden is not in the driver seat. They are also the ones that have been lying to you about this man&#39;s mental. Fitness. And they are still lying to us. Don&#39;t be stupid enough to think that You can vote for a better democrat."

4906,Americans help us vote Trump again
4907,On president Biden first election I bet he will win and only a one time president! He should allow another Democrat run with Trump ! Otherwise! Sad😊
4908,"Biden walks out on stage, because of how used to giving speeches in n company of his close yes man circle he walks onto the stage hearing a roaring crowd chanting <br><br> Crowd- “4 more years, 4 more years” <br><br>Biden waves at the moderators and the crowd. The lights stop him from seeing the waves of people that aren’t actually present because he forgot there was no audience. <br><br><br> Biden- “thank you thank YOU”<br><br>As if he was capping off the audience volume. <br><br>If you watch his speeches you’ll notice the same Means of capping off the audience for a quick rebuttal. <br><br>Biden actually said even more but they cut off his mic"
4909,I didn&#39;t like trump that much but I&#39;d rather vote for him than biden that much
4910,"&quot;They&#39;re doing more for veterans than ever before,&quot; Biden says. I&#39;m sorry, but with what staff? The ones you pushed out with vaccine mandates before deciding to not require shots after all? The ones who jumped ship to other hospitals when the VA couldn&#39;t match the pay increases everyone else offered to keep up with the inflation your administration caused? The VA I&#39;m in touch with had to cut back on the total number of beds they could fill because they don&#39;t have enough nurses to tend to a full building. A vet that I knew was unable to get admitted for in-patient hospice because the wait list for a bed was just too long."
4911,"Interest rates are up, inflation is up, and pay and jobs are down. Thanks Biden. <br>Trump 2024💯"

4919,"If I have to hear &quot;we&#39;re in a position where&quot;, or &quot;the idea that&quot; one more time..."
4920,"Joe FYI This country is already bankrupt. Your reckless spending doesn&#39;t help the USA at all. Look at the National Debt Joe and its crazy interest every minute that goes by. I am wondering if you ever took a college course in Economics. But if you did, you forgot all the basics. Yoru idea that Tax and Spend, illegal immigration, your continual 6 working hours a day, and continual vacations tells the American people you just don&#39;t care about us."

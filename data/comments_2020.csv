2,"Watching the US president (from Australia) completely fumble the ball, not just during this debate but the last 3yrs has been so blatantly obvious and unsettling. How some ppl don’t see it is beyond me. <br><br>To who ever reads this, know that God loves you. He sees you and He cares about you. I pray you talk with Him and find love and perfect peace through Jesus Christ. Amen."
3,Of all the intelligent and articulate professional politicians the length and breadth of America - these two Muppets are your Presidential Candidates!!! Oh my god! What a disgrace!
4,"Biden is reading everything he&#39;s saying. Meanwhile, Trump is freestyling his responses with finesse and dropping the 🎤"
5,"Everytime I do or say something wrong now, my excuse? I have a cold from beating medicaid."
6,why is biden&#39;s stare so goofy though
7,Definitely not prepared by the Biden cult.<br> Why no questions about bidens illegitimate gains in ukraine.
8,First presidential debate that did not have the USA flag in the background. Libs hate this country
9,Keep  the government out of childcare
10,Biden mostly made sense when he was blaming trump for things but rarely when answering questions for himself 😂😂😂
11,Why did they  keep calling trump president.
12,It’s crazy how the lesser evil last election became the greater evil only one election later.
13,You ask way to much about hitting the like button try to at least cut it down to 2 or 3
14,What is going on..
15,A “Coin toss” on millions of peoples lives is wild
16,Trump 2024
17,"The American people deserve better than biden. He was a disaster, didnt sound Presidential, has no class and is a crook. I have more sense than to vote for him."
18,"READ THE WHOLE COMMENT BEFORE REPLYING<br>As a trump supporter I believe that Biden won the election even if there was election fraud which there most likely was. There were pictures of <b>**what was said to be**</b> dumped paper ballots. Anyways, even if there wasn’t any election fraud, I still think biden would have won. The reason is because the media shoves all of this misinformation down your throat about trump being some evil monster and biden being some saint. The fact is, none of them are saints, but when it comes down to trump or biden, my vote goes to trump because he is not and has not constantly caused inflation to sky rocket, he can form sentences, and he has respect from our enemies. The respect from our enemies sounds bad when you read it or hear it, but when you think about it, if we had respect from Russia and China and North Korea then there is a much less chance of having a war with them. Abraham Lincoln once said “The best way to get rid of your enemies is to make them your friends.”."
19,"OMG, the Bidens and dems are so crooked and senile"
20,Countries of the largest pollution- the US isn’t even in the top 100
21,Why are the democrats putting this guy up again?<br>Clearly a corrupt senile puppet
22,"Blimey ! American politics is in just as bad shape as ours in Britain ! Surely America has politicians like Hawley and Cruz who would do a decent job ! This was painful to watch, Joe Biden is unable to orate !"
23,បាទជំរាបសួរ♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹🌹
24,Republicans should be begging the DNC to keep Biden in the election. It’s a guaranteed win for Trump.
25,"From now on...King/Queen UNTIL DEATH, natural or because WE THE PEOPLE KNOW they&#39;re not doing their job...ONE PERSON RESPONSIBLE for political decisions period...no Congress, just Govenors reporting the VOTE OF THE PEOPLE on THEIR AREA ISSUES...then when dead, a NEW FAMILY ELECTED based on MORAL BEHAVIORS."
26,No audience. Biden proceeds to wave at an audience thats not there.
27,"Why are we not talking about Biden having Notes. It was stated in the RULES, NO NOTHING."
28,I&#39;m still voting for you Mr President !!!
29,Just hoping for a candidate who can at least remember what day it is! 🙄
30,Wow...Biden thinks that we have not lived the past 8 years in the United States...We must not know how it has been literally living here
31,"IMHO i believe Biden has dementia just as bad as Regan had it in his last yr as president.  <br><br>If he (god help us) wins, his handlers will have to pull off a 25th amendment and we&#39;ll end up with cackling Harris running the nation."
32,🤡🤡 horrible
33,Trump for 2024
34,GIVE A THUMBS UP 👍🏽 BIDENS IS THE WORST PRESIDENT EVER 💯 I GIVE 10x 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
35,didnt most countries/empires fall because of incompetent leaders?
36,"The question at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=3060"">51:00</a> makes no sense. How is that anyone elses problem?"
37,"If the election is CLEAN, LEGAL, AND FAIR, then yes, of course Trump would accept the results of the election and so will his voters. But we know the childish entitled privileged activist liberal left doesn&#39;t like to play by the rules. They&#39;ll throw a tantrum and won&#39;t accept the results of the election if it&#39;s not in their favor which is why they&#39;ll try to cheat again to gaslight this country into believing another illusion. Why do you think liberal organizations kept pushing out surveys on social media asking who you&#39;d vote for? It&#39;s so they can get a behind the scenes idea of how many people are likely to vote against Democrats in order to get the data needed to calibrate their hackable electronic voting machines to cheat the election again."
38,Trump is pure evil
39,It needs to stop being called the Israeli OFFENSIVE. They&#39;re DEFENDING themselves &amp; CANNOT lay down their weapons now. Islam IS the anti-Christ.
40,Joe entered like a senile old man. Trump entered like he owned that building. If y&#39;all didn&#39;t vote based on twitter this man would have never lost the elections previously.
41,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=671"">11:11</a> was Biden crying?"
42,Trump makes biden look bad. Inflation is at its worst. People are struggling with food prices to make ends meet. The War and gas prices was also devastating. Someone step up and make america great again. People should not struggle.
43,"All they do is unethically mock one another. Zero leadership. Zero example to young people. Zero speaking about their plan. The way they speak, and especially Trump, is a shame."
44,After every thing we know i can&#39;t believe that anyone not know what a massive clear and present danger.every word out of trump&#39;s mouth a complete and utter lie
45,"80 should be the absolute age limit and cutoff to run for president. If not 60, why is Biden running and not in hospice?"
46,USA national debt as right now 34 trillion
47,"80 should be the absolute age limit and cutoff to run for president. If not 60, why is Biden running and not in hospice?"
48,Trump went to 2trillion  breaking record 😂 why Joe don’t say that he broke trump record with 32 trillion 😂😂
49,If trump did his job during COVID-19 the death toll would of been 1 tenth but he lied because he didn&#39;t want it to interfere with his fund raising he bragged to how knew it was deadly December of 2019 that&#39;s voluntary manslaughter
50,Trump is so great
51,Biden and his administration are the absolute worst. I live in the proof everyday
52,"I’m a democrat and will not vote for Bidan if he is the only president left. Worst president, inflation, support for Israel committing genocides and pushing transgender cult to our schools confusing our children. Worse administration. Trump is right and I can’t stand the guy (voted against him elections) we are a 3rd word country now and heading down hill! If it comes down between Trump and Joe I’m voting Trump. Very disappointed with biden he wasted my vote as far as my concerned and he is not going to get it this time. Will vote trump if it comes down to chose between the two, and may change parties completely!<br><br>Hope Trump changes a broken justice system, where prosecutors with unlimited resources/ and tax  payers money can charge / indict anyone without the presence of the defense or defendants to include Trump himself (and he is a billionaire and a former US president not just a regular Citizen) with multiple cumulative sentencing charges against US Citizens for the same crime, causing us to be the country with highest incarceration per capita in the world, harsh sentences destroying lives families without any rehabilitation whatsoever in private sector corrupt incarceration system that benefits from increase of inmates mostly minorities that go out and can&#39;t get a job anywhere cause their records are damaged and can&#39;t  get a public trust or any gov clearance to work for their own government …so they turn back to crime. The crime is at its highest and kills more than what world terrorism combined!!His response is putting more police forces, no rehabilitation programs whatsoever while other countries are turning their prisons into hotels we are building more prisons. A corrupt justice system where a person with expensive lawyer gets a plea deal and the one that can’t afford one gets a harsh sentence for the same crime or not post bail rotting in jail for 6month and losing everything (house, job…) even after the fact he was found not guilty. Saying this is the most admired country he is delusional. This has become the worst country behind the ones with dictatorship regimes? we lost credibility and no one respect us anymore. <br><br>When justice fail everything else will follow and vise versa. A French citizen slapped their president got sentenced to 4 month and a year and half probation.  He will be spending the rest of his life in jail if not dead, would it have happened in here! All modern countries sentencing is based on the highest charge plus the guidelines.  That’s justice! In here black peoples die for a speeding infractions, young kids make a mistake they spend their life in jail and the stigma that follows. We become Natzi police state, and Biden&#39;s answer is put more police forces out there, like it&#39;s going to keep us safe! Shame!!!"
53,Biden is a lying scoundrel.
54,Biden: “the idea”<br><br>We have no ‘idea’ what you’re talking about😂😂😂
55,Why didn&#39;t CNN have the American Flag on stage?
56,This was actually one of Biden&#39;s best performances in the last 2 years. I don&#39;t know what everyone is talking about. He is usually way worse.
57,"Donald Trump is the Godfather.He&#39;s a real Godfather.<br>It&#39;s boss More powerful than the mafia,"
58,This man is too old to even talk . I am amazed he was able to stand up for the rebate . He need to do himself a favor and step down and not run for another term . Poor Biden need to rehire already 😳
59,"Also it was Abbott and desantis who bused thousands of immigrants shipped àll over the country as a political stunt PS the immigrants i mentioned crossed the border legally in danger ING innocent men women and children dumping them northern states in the freezing cold, There&#39;s a reason many people call trump orange Hitler"
60,"Trump said the same talkingpoint as the german left party:<br>&quot; u cant have social security , private property &amp; open borders at the same time . u need to choose 2 of them ! &quot;"
61,"the only time the USA citizens became stupid was when they elected you, Trump, as their president! You trump has no class and intelligence don&#39;t have the intelligence of past USA presidents and all you know is using and saying &#39;witch hunt&#39; and being in Twitter most of the time- and most of all bringing your own citizens to destroy things and be in constant anger and rebellions!"
62,"I listened to 10 mins of this debate, and although Biden speaks weakly compared to trump, all that Trump is speaking is b.s  and hopping around the bush. The debate  is not only weka because one of the leader speaks weakly but it&#39;s not even related. How do you rebuttal a tax cut only for wealthy, what new jobs? Are you forgetting implementations of Ai that will immediately result in loses of millions of jobs.<br>We will continue to struggle, we will find something. But it sucks that you serve for corporate for 2 decades and then they give you a project that mandates automation and it&#39;s fine print reads assist in brining solution that will automate your  departments job. Precovid and during covid we had digitalization, sure That was helpful and it assisted, it also affected few personnel, but still it was mainly about assisting and convinience. Now it&#39;s about immediate result and 0 dependency on personnel.  More than a race to service customers efficiently it&#39;s about race to quickly profit off of this technology by corporates. Deduct tax on these ppl.. 😂😂😂"
63,"Tump had his moments, but by the gods I have neer seen such a weak leader like Biden. THe man can&#39;t talk clearly, he is too old and too weak. He sounds like a bumbaling fool."
64,Question 3: Trump lied again. Trump mishandled Covid. I lived through it. Documented it and it’s fact.
65,Trump is Insane and Biden is Senile 😂
66,Trump destroyed him in first 5 minutes 😂
67,"Question 2: Inflation is too much money chasing too many goods. This was triggered by Covid and tariffs could lower the goods imported, reducing the number of goods and increasing inflation."
68,"why everybody saying that Biden made a terrible debate - maybe in one or two questions - but he did made good points. I think what Biden has to do is to speak much louder and clearer! I think Trump won on speech delivery. However, a convicted fraudster a liar former president should not even be there to speak not even earned the moral right to be a candidate and more importantly be legally allowed to do that- what a joke!"
69,US makes the best tv entertainment
70,People making fun of Trumps age is funny haha like Biden isn&#39;t 100x worse?
71,On trump&#39;s orders he had his maga goons sabotage Bidens border bill trump is why the border is weakened
72,"Question 1: Boyh presidents told the truth. However, Trump lied about the greatest ever and he fumbled the ball during Covid. He told people to drink bleach."
73,"Can we just all agree not to vote until new candidates are an option. This is embarrassing for the entire country, on both sides of the political bird."
74,Remember trump the dictator empty the treasury with his family and now for many years the americans will pay high taxes for the loss of the treasury.
75,"Why aren&#39;t the 88,000 children brought up that Biden and his administration lost?  Human trafficking needs to be addressed"
76,Trump as drug adicted taking his dose on a daily basis that&#39;s why performing on the presentation. While in some sessions in the court missed drug doses were behaving crasy.
77,Prevedi na hrvstski
78,Other than the little uttering episodes that Biden experience in this debate he still did better than that lying mongrel Trump....
79,THESE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NOT OUR BUSINESS!! We Need to WORRY ABOUT OUR OWN COUNTRY!!!! STOP SPENDING OUR MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER COUNTRIES!!!
80,"After this performance, the world is less safe. Clearly Joe Biden is not run ing the country, he&#39;s not fit to be president. The Democrat along with white house staff have been lying for 4yrs. If any of you continue to support a democrat or liberal candidate youre a threat to this republic. I will say again that our enemies saw this performance and are now less safe."
81,"we should care for ourselves before welcoming the outsiders. benefit should be give for the citizens in primary, priority and period. thank you. no further qn and answer."
82,Fallen America why don&#39;t you provide chair to Joe Biden if he falls from that platform who is going to take the responsibility/incharge for that 😂😅
83,Biden intentionally let trump run his mouth showing his true colors
84,GOD BLESS TRUMP...PLEASE  JESUS  PLEASE  HELP TRUMP WIN 2024
85,Quick question:<br>Is it proper to address a former president as &#39;President&#39; Trump? I thought that term was only reserved for the current president.
86,Biden just lies to us about things we know are a lie. He doesn&#39;t buy groceries or gas. He doesn&#39;t deal with the issues average Americans do. All of the issues were dealing with in America And we&#39;re angry that women can&#39;t unalive their babies. America is morally bankrupt. The politicians are the most corrupt humans I have ever seen.
87,"In old times, both candidates used to greet cordially each other before the debate. How time have changed. And Biden speaking so fast so he won&#39;t forget what he&#39;s supposed to say."
88,Biden is a joke
89,Can you here the train coming.

91,From Italy...Kamon Donald!!!❤
92,Biden is a joke
93,It&#39;s disgusting that the host never allow Trump  to respond what Biden said about Trump.
94,"Biden can&#39;t even speak, and he gets lost in his own words and thinking. How embarrassing  this man negotiates  for the people.<br>It&#39;s also terrible that Biden and his team are weaponizing the government to personally attack an American citizen who&#39;s running for president.<br>I was cut off state medicade for making to much 11k a year but yet illegals get money , housing , free cell phone, and health benefits. What&#39;s wrong with this ideal  called Biden economics. <br>Biden must leave office now he&#39;s destroying this country !!!"
95,"Trump = WINER, Biden = Socialist (also called Loser, its the same)"
96,Most admired county in the world ?.. that&#39;s the funniest thing I&#39;ve ever heard ...! the world hates the US .... I&#39;ve no respect at all for Trump or Biden.... they both support the war in Ukraine &amp; the genocide in Gaza

101,"I&#39;m not American and certainly don&#39;t wanna step on anyone&#39;s toes , but I realized Biden is starting lose the debate approximately around 5.50 min going through the video. <br>Kudos to the man."
102,TRUMP DIDNT MAKE ANYONE LOSE Jobs either
103,So illegal migrants get Medicare?  Disgusting!  Any American that thinks that is ok needs to independently support illegal migrants. This current administration needs to be put in prison for treason
104,Trump is so uncouth and hateful.  Trump exaggerates and lies.  Trump does not care about the American people. He only cares about power.

121,"Biden is so confident that even his voice wavers every time he speaks.  After the country rejected him pretty much his whole career, now all of a sudden, after all this time, the country wants him as president?  The political system benefits only politicians, now more than ever."
122,The election between Trump and Biden is the choise between plague and cholera. Both can be kicked in the bin.
123,Go Donald
124,You saved Israel????? Stop Lying Joe
125,Please Can you Americans truly make the world peaceful again that is what we need
126,Biden talks like English isn’t his first language the way he struggles to put sentences together. He’s only coherent at the beginning because he just calls people names and tries insults but on the topics he sounds like he’s stumbling up a set of airplane stairs
127,Trump destroyed Biden in this debate he says it how it is he runs the country much better than Biden by far

181,Biden about to croak let’s be real
182,Something has to change.
183,"This is a very random take on it, but I am a Toastmaster (member of a club that is all about public speaking) and am having fun counting all the public speaking mistakes Biden made. To name a few<br><br>-first off, that absolutely bizarre pouty facial expression he first walked up with and keeps for 99% of the whole thing. Greeting your audience with a face like that does NOT make them feel good about you at all. He’s slouching too. <br><br>-he’s slurring his words and mumbling, and not talking loudly enough<br><br>-he also does a LOT of run-on sentences that go off into tangents"
184,President Trump please remind people how Biden looked at his watch as they were unloading bodies that were repatriated! He’s a disgusting liar.
185,Biden looks  very unhealthy. The way he walks and talks. It does not matter if you like him or not. He just looks sick. The way he shuffled his feet. The way he walked. And he continued to make mistakes when he spoke. My grandfather looked like this before he came very ill. There&#39;s a time when you just got to give up and walk away.  He needs give up and go home and live out his days.
186,If Trump doesn’t win the election it’s not going to be a bright future for the USA
187,"oh my goodness... are they really talking about their capabilities to play golf? And this is their proof to be capable to run a country like  USA? 🙈 You deserve so much better. Greetings from a country in deep trouble as well, good old Germany"
188,That mouth almost got us outta here last time
189,They got him outta there the first time for a reason he hasnt changed.
190,Trump is full of lies and Biden is incoherent . You are doomed no matter who you vote for
191,Why does Biden look so unconfident and worried?
192,Hard not to 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 <i>____</i>
193,Biden has become valedictorian at the saul alinsky school of make belueve. He cant convince anybody and trumpey bear2024 has shattereed hus kupa bucks plans with facts and tryth abd self control. A++ trumpy bear 2024!!!!❤😂🎉
194,Biden  and  Trump - katastrofa   USA   and  Univers.
195,"idaho expects to follow the federal law. making decisions is leadership, not &quot;let them figure it out themselves&quot; and then he turns around and says &quot;oh they can&#39;t make their own decisions. ... stuff like this is why i don&#39;t like trump, despite that attitude represents a lot of americans."

198,"I agree with the Democrats. The Joe Biden we are seeing is the best version in his life !  His quick wit, his ability to understand where he is has never been better... DONT LET THEM TALK YOU INTO PULLING OUT OF THE RACE ! The votes and electors belong to Joe and only he can chose to withdraw.  They better not try the 25th Ammendment clause because joe has the sharpest mind in the entire democratic party !"
199,Veterans before illegals 2024.
200,"i think trump is delusional, like clinically insane. everything is either the &quot;greatest&quot; or the &quot;worst&quot;. just not living in reality."
201,Biden is not trying to help working class people: his only concern is helping immigrants that migrate over illegally.. Biden in my opinion is not a president of the people or for the people: perhaps he need to run for a president at the border or Mexico- I just started Medicare due to retirement and I can only work and make so much money- at 66 I’m going to have to work 2 jobs to make ends meet- Biden is a president for illegal immigrants and I agree with Trump- this president is doing a horrible job and I pray he is soon fired.. Biden prob need to be in a assisted living facility: that’s a lie there is nothing for Elder care or child care- just immigrant care… A person who can’t care for their own household ( country) is worse than an infidel
202,I wish I had some alcohol right now

209,"All countries are preparing for the 3rd world war. So what is the main reason that brought our world to this threshold? Isn&#39;t the fact that every country, except a few Scandinavian countries, considers its own interests superior to the world&#39;s interests, and this is the plundering of the world ecosystem for this purpose? If humanity&#39;s goal is to unlock the secrets of our universe and discover other worlds, we must do this without making our world uninhabitable or starting wars. Otherwise, as long as we have such a flawed paradigm, we will always remain a harmful nuisance, even if we disperse all over the universe. So, if we don&#39;t cut our own umbilical cord ourselves, how do we know that artificial intelligence will not see humanity as a virus and destroy it before reaching this stage? Therefore, before it is too late, we must establish democratic governments on our own initiative, under the guidance of science, under the management of educated and conscious people, in order to transform our world into a more livable place"
210,No such thing of the Climate Crisis!
211,"The Federal Reserve is Privately owned...The Worldwide Central Bank System has enslaved the World with debt-based fiat &quot;currency&quot; and the D party takes its&#39; marching orders from them.  There has never been a more serious election in our history or lives.  If Trump were to lose the US is over, and the World, but. he Trump will win.  There will be a false flag in the next 4 month - internet down, riots, mass shooting, election virus, and maybe war - something. The elites are panicking but God Wins and the Patriots are in control."
212,these two are the 2 worsts presidents in history of US.
213,For history <br>these two idiots support Israel <br>against “terrorism” 😅😅
214,Biden cant even speak
215,I agree with Trump because my experience none of our military personnel has the respect of the immigrants and some Americans.
216,Trump dont say illegal immigrants when your family wasnt even legal
217,"Biden&#39;s facial expressions are priceless!  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=667"">11:07</a> all down hill for Biden from there, soon as I heard the jibberish, I put some popcorn in the microwave cause I knew It was gonna get comical after that, he was going over reasons and forgot where he was after 2 lolol  Trump can not take too long with his responses or Ol Joe will fall asleep. You know Joe has a earpiece in his ear so they can keep him awake. WAKE UP!!! JOE IT&#39;&#39;S YOUR TURN Joe-huh  lol  They had to cut him off when he start rambling lolol"

219,"Everybody was amazed by how Trump did ???<br>Other people laughed at how bad he handled ever single situation 😂😂😂<br>Trump lost 2.7 million jobs <br><br>Trump assured the public in 2017 that the U.S. economy with his tax cuts would grow at “3%,” but he added, “I think it could go to 4, 5, and maybe even 6%, ultimately.”<br><br>If the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation averaged 2.67% under Trump, according to figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Include the pandemic-induced recession and that average drops to an anemic 1.45%.<br><br>By contrast, growth during the second term of then-President Barack Obama averaged 2.33%. So far under Biden, annual growth is averaging 3.4%.<br><br>If you belief in Trump you have brain rod"
220,"Honestly it makes me sick to hear the moaning how bad Biden performed. In my opinion there&#39;s a very serious advantage between what I hear from president Biden in the debate, and the picture of incapable old guy built by Trump - Russian trolls in social media. Actually he surprised me with his advanced understanding of politics. Trump had all these years to learn, but he didn&#39;t. If Americans will choose him, it really means USA is past."
221,Trump did deregulate laws for companies so that they could poison our water air and soil and food ...
222,Debacle of low inflation and interest rates.
223,Biden is correct on taxes ..<br>Extra wealthy need to pay the same taxes too...<br>Trump did want to stop social security.<br>Biden is telling the truth about that.
224,"Where is the wall?  We were promised a wall, and it&#39;s falling apart.  Mexico hasn&#39;t paid us anything for it either."

238,After listening to both...<br>Neither one is fit to be president...<br>Both lie and have done bad things...<br>I&#39;m definitely voting for Robert Kennedy Jr after watching this....🎉🎉🎉
239,"I found this very difficult to watch. To me it looks like Biden may have had a minor stroke or something.  His left side does not seem to be fully working, his speech is impaired &amp; he looses his train of thought. It&#39;s actually quite sad to watch, I think for his own welfare he needs to stand down."
240,Grandpa for President!
241,Sleepy joe
242,The pre manufacturered conversation  btwteen cnn and the biden campaign was almost unnoticeable.... good job cnn

I tell people what if it was you that your parents decided to have Abortion with you you wouldnt be alive today. I&#39;m sorry but watching this I just want to tell Biden to shut up....Im sorry.

257,Thanks you
258,This guy is obviously not really leading our country he&#39;s a face for an agenda. An if he messes up he&#39;s just going to die an not face any repercussions. I think that&#39;s why they use presidents as old as they do.

260,Biden is a Joke!
261,"&quot;Countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China... and many other countries, in all fairness to China&quot; 🤣😂"
262,The border situation....<br>Anyone that crosses over and does so illegally is an illegal immigrant...<br>Illegal immigrants should be sent back no questions about it. <br>People that are coming in this country should come in legally and should be checked to make sure they&#39;re not a criminal or any other type of dangerous person. <br>Trump is correct on the border issue.
263,It&#39;s so sad😢looks like Biden has got of the death bed !!
264,Keep in mind that Biden did nothing but practice for this debate for a whole week.
265,"“Sundowners” is real, y’all."
266,"To be honest, none of us could form complete sentences if we&#39;re in diapers full of crap live in front of 300 million people"
267,I have to say... Both Trump and Biden are wrong on the topic of abortion...<br>Fact...<br>Women should have the right to choose....<br>BUT....<br>There has to be a time limit put on that...<br>Like 18 weeks...<br>Or.... Unless it&#39;s life-threatening to the mother.

270,Joe Biden = Word Salad
271,This is not a debate

279,"Sytuacja identyczna jak w Polsce. Zmieniają się tylko zarzuty każdej ze stron wobec przeciwnika. Konflikt w którym i jedni i drudzy są realnie czemuś winni i odpowiadają za pewne kwestie. Niestety tak jak w Polsce nie ma konsensusu refleksji czy realnej oceny stanu rzeczy. Obrzucanie wzajemnie zarzutami, zatrzymywanie przez organy ścigania, procesy sądowe. Smutne bo cierpią zwykli obywatele natomiast politycy mają się świetnie żyjąc na nasz koszt i z naszej pracy robiąc niewiele dla ludzi za to bardzo dużo robią dla samych siebie i swoich kolegów z frakcji."
280,"Biden wants to decide everything, the people have no say in it."

293,I don’t wanna see these two run again at all 😭
294,Omgoodness Biden just let it loose again &amp; during the debate.... he&#39;s such an embarrassment of a leader periodt.
295,The way Biden can continually speak lies is beyond me.. he&#39;s in major denial or just trying to bs us. And the way Trump&#39;s owning to most of what tried to use to attack him is awesome. And the look on  Biden&#39;s face when Trump owns it is PRICELESS! -THE WIFE

His criminal administration cut funding for the VA and F&#39;ed over a bunch of us. Thanks to Biden, I have hearing aids. I can finally hear my children properly. That is thanks to Biden. I get medical help through the Choice Program. Obama&#39;s administration started the Choice Program, Trump cut funding for the Choice Program (while falsely claiming that he started the Choice Program).

403,What trump says Biden has done trump is guilty of!
404,"I can’t listen to trump anymore, his lies just repulse me!"
405,All I know is when Trump was president I had more money and everything was cheaper how can people not see that? He was the best president of my life time anyone should be able to see that.
406,For health and safety reasons for politicians and the American citizens. I believe there needs to be a max age for public servants. I think it would be beneficial for allowing different perspectives from younger representatives to create a plan to solve problems and stay relevant to current times and trends. Of course some issues regarding these perspectives could cause a loop just like our current situation. <br><br>Thoughts?
407,So far Biden is right about Putin being a war criminal.
408,Belarus is not in NATO Biden 😂
409,So embarrassing 🙈
410,Most major cities are DONE. 90% eastern states and 100% democratic states. It is sad to see a state like NYC and CA infested with bugs looting hardworking workers tax money.

416,All Biden had was name calling.  Over &amp; over again.  Trump kept his cool &amp; let Biden flap his mouth.  His mental faculties are terribly diminished. Jill Biden should be in trouble for elder abuse!
417,Why wasn&#39;t RFK Jr. apart of this debate🤥 really goes to show the media is a show
418,Biden doesnt even know how to speak

425,They tried cutting the feed a few times bc Biden rambling but that didn’t work out to well
426,"I’m not 190% clear on either sides abortion perspectives but I believe that if a woman is carrying an “un-viable” child (example. A child where the brain is developed outside of the skull, a child (in the 3rd trimester) that will not live outside of utero due to a medical condition and other conditions that I may not be aware of) should be able to end those pregnancies without any fault. But things like that should be the only way 3rd term abortion should happen. Are people really aborting healthy pregnancies?"
427,Yes it is hard to hear biden speak but he has facts behind his statements trump doesnt. When trump said terrorist have crossed the border he had no facts and then biden brought up 3 solders were killed under trump and he had no reply
428,Watching Biden is literally like watching Saturday night live!
429,Biden didn&#39;t say a single coherent or on topic sentence.
430,biden reached podium:achievement
431,All Biden said was to criticize Trump admin but has practically not said something good he did for America...
432,Let&#39;s count the number of times Joe says &#39;the idea&#39; and &#39;oh by the way&#39;.
433,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=668"">11:08</a> Biden sounds like he was trying to push out a turd...somebody get this man some help."

437,Yeah <b>we</b> as a <b>nation</b> are <b>cooked</b>
438,"I, watching this pathetic &quot;debate&quot; from the Middle East - know that Joe Biden, (like most around here who know American history) due to his support and zeal for wars - has indirectly caused much suffering, misery, agony and uncountable deaths around this region. For us here who know Biden and his record in relation to events here, it&#39;s impossible to have any liking or respect for him.<br><br>As for America being the most admired country in the world, that was years go, before all the horrific wars - Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and now Gaza - which all America were/are deeply involved in. To Trump&#39;s credit, he, maybe, is the least war supporting  president in the history of the US."

456,We’re cooked.. 🫡 God Bless 🇺🇸
457,Biden is full of it.  Economy and jobs were better under Trump until COVID hit.  Our nation was in a MUCH better economic state after all the work he did to improve that.
458,Biden looks like a corpse!
459,Where are all the pro-Biden comments?
460,Trump: 🥴 🤨 <br>Biden: 😟😟😐
461,"Wow... first &quot;fact&quot; rattled off by CNN is a lie.  Prices ARE still up, but not $100 is now $120.  I&#39;ve seen numerous people&#39;s WalMart carts and orders from a few years ago and now, and its 300% higher.  Same items (just have to hit reorder to see), same location.

469,Awesome Trump ❤
470,😊😊
471,"The dumbest debate arrangement ever, stupid questions in the first place, then moderators were unable follow their own rules, let candidates focused on their own agendas instead of answering directly to the issues raised. Worse let Trump sent on with his lies unchecked.<br>CNN approached with the only goal in mind was to get more right wings audiences (money talks)"
472,"They should both withdraw. <br>Trump was mispronouncing and slurring too, he just does it rapid fire. He couldn&#39;t finish answering a question. They are both too old. For the love of the country they should both agree to put someone else in."

483,"Biden is in need of Medicare himself, as he seems to be suffering from “ midway speech delay syndrome “ As his thought process is lapsing and shifting in nonsensical and irrelevant directions,he is a picture of someone looking pitiful while Trump is behaving like an hyperactive talkative kid in kindergarten going on and on complaining to his Mom who comes to pick him up,unfortunately so, running for presidency of the United States is serious business that needs serious discussion, not some stand up comedy show disguised as a “ presidential debate “🇺🇸❤️🌍"
484,"We need younger candidates, keeping them in is elder abuse."
485,Bro biden got destroyed 😂😂

548,The idea 💡 👌 😂
549,"Trump is speaking actual Facts and Truth , this family is voting Trump 2024 !!!!!"
550,"Why do we trade with other countries? Why aren&#39;t we making our own things. Why can&#39;t each country be self supporting and then do a little trading. We have moved all of our textiles overseas in the 90s. We use to make towels and tshirts and clothes. We outsourced all of that overseas. Now we have to import it. Doesn&#39;t make alot od sense. You put alot of workers out of jobs. I worked for an industrial power transmission distributor at the time. Sold sprockets, motors, bearings, vbelts all things that keep manufacturing plants going. Our company was in 5 cities in SC and we went from 60 employees to 30. That was NAFTA. We need to keep America companies in the united States. Keep our money here. Our country is being gutted one industry at a time.<br>Look at what haa happened with food processing and farming the past few yrs. First we won&#39;t be able to make a living. Then we won&#39;t be able to feed ourselves. How about free up land from the federal lands for agriculture in each state to help feed the people. Put homeless and unemployed to work. If they are motivated and show initiative they will move up and outbof those jobs."
551,Biden looks &amp; speaks like a Sick Old Man and I can’t believe people actually want to Vote for him !!!!
552,How about............. No.
553,If America re-elects Biden we will  become  the most weak and vulnerable target for the communist block and their allies. Are the powerful left Mafia in the USA ready to face such a risk?

595,They never answer the question
596,Climate change is way to tax USA citizen why the world pollutes
597,Why no fact checks? Lies by one side which go unchallenged make the moderators and CNN complicit in those lies. CNN is no longer a News Organisation. Trump is right saying CNN is fake news. The &quot;moderators&quot; deserve to lose their careers for their disservice to America and the Free World.

624,🖕🤣🍺  LETS GO BRANDEN!
625,"How about we stop borrowing money from central banks and print our own money. You know like Lincoln and Kennedy and several other countries wanted to do. I think we should revamp everything. When a man and women get married give them a 10 yr loan to build a house. Each child born to them cancels out 25% of that loan.<br>That will help incentivise marriage and building a family. The woman is what will help the future civilization continue to keep going. If the US creates its own money and spends it locally on goods and services wouldn&#39;t that help our economy grow. If we look out for our own people first, it will make them stronger working for the good of all. By that i mean the good of our nation overall. Not giving up thier individuality or the taking away the value from each persons effort. No trophies for all. Some people are brighter and invent things. They should be recognized for thier efforts. We are not all the same. But with some changes, EVERYONE, could have  a basic life with food and housing and medical. If you want more, then you will be motivated to achieve more. No work , no food. No freeloader. Everyone can do something to earn thier minimal keep. BUT elderly should be cared for by family because we should respect and honor our elders. If no family then then that falls to the community.  Sick. Infirmed, Orphans should be looks after. Thats only commin sense and humanitarian sense. We love our brothers and sisters. <br>All of the bad influences that tear apart families, morals and values need to be stopped. Media is terrible. It is used to change your views of things. Families, strong families and communities should be the main influencers in our little ones coming up. <br>We need a total revamp."

630,"Nice try bidet...Trump Took early action to cut off travel from China<br>Built the world’s leading testing system from nothing<br>Enacted mitigation measures to slow the spread<br>Mobilized public and private sectors to secure needed supplies<br>Took action to protect vulnerable Americans<br>Launched effort to deliver a vaccine and therapeutics in record time<br>Provided support to workers and businesses<br>Paved way for reopening to get America working again<br>Surged resources to hot spots as they arose<br>Confronted China as origin of the virus while Democrats and media cowered....At the outset, President Trump took action to stop travel from China to stem the spread to the United States as long as possible.<br>While Democrats were focused on their impeachment sham, President Trump took swift and decisive action to stop travel from China in January and enhanced airport screenings to help stop cases from coming into the United States as long as possible.<br>In his February 4th State of the Union address, President Trump pledged to “take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from the virus,” while the Democrats’ response made not a single mention of the virus or even the threat of China.<br>President Trump built the world’s leading testing system from nothing, based on a virus we have never faced before.<br>In order to accurately trace and combat this virus, President Trump set out to build the world’s best testing system, and that’s exactly what he did.<br>We have already conducted more than 65 million tests, far outpacing any other country.<br>As soon as cases began to rise, President Trump released guidance to slow the spread.<br>President Trump released guidance recommending mitigation measures critical to slowing the spread of the virus, and the American people stepped up to do their part.<br>Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx have attested to the fact that President Trump took action as soon as the data was presented to him.<br>In order to secure the supplies needed to confront the surge in coronavirus we faced, President Trump led the largest mobilization of public and private sector resources since WWII.<br>The President directed his Administration to secure and distribute needed medical supplies to states in need – resulting in billions of PPE delivered so far.<br>At the President’s urging, private companies shifted production to supplying masks, ventilators, hand sanitizer, testing supplies, and more.<br>President Trump has acted under the Defense Production Act more than 30 times to ensure we have the supplies we need.<br>When we faced a potentially catastrophic shortage of ventilators, President Trump took action to produce 100,000 ventilators and ensure no patient who needs one goes without a ventilator."

Devastating candidates again! US should be ashamed of this return match."
692,"As an American who was born during the Reagan Presidency, I can give 10 reasons why Trump is worse than Biden. For good reason, I am not a big fan of both and don&#39;t like either party. 1. Handling of COVID-19: His administration was criticized for downplaying the severity of the pandemic, which potentially led to higher infection and death rates. 2. Riot at the Capital: Trump&#39;s rhetoric and actions surrounding the 2020 election are widely seen as contributing to the January 6th insurrection. 3. Environmental Policies: He rolled back numerous environmental protections, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and promoting fossil fuel use. 4. Healthcare: Trump made multiple attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a clear replacement, risking millions&#39; healthcare coverage. 5. Immigration Policies: Biden did not handle the border well at all, but Trump&#39;s administration implemented the controversial family separation policy, which is evil. 6. Foreign Relations: Trump&#39;s approach to international relations, including alienating traditional allies and cozying up to authoritarian leaders, was often criticized. 7. Racial Tensions: Trump’s rhetoric and policies are seen as exacerbating racial tensions, including his handling of the Black Lives Matter protests. 8. Truthfulness: Trump was documented to have made thousands of false or misleading statements during his presidency. and lastly  9. Respect for Institutions and Indecency: Trump&#39;s attacks on the media, judiciary, and electoral system were seen as undermining democratic institutions and norms. Listen, I am not a Biden or Trump supporter. Biden has many flaws. He is old, and his handling of the border was horrible, but I would much rather have him over a criminal and a very big liar. I believe most politicians are liars, but I would rather believe anything Biden says than Trump. God bless America. and my arguments are debatable, I know."

804,"This &quot;presidential&quot; debate was more like an unhinged Jerry Springer episode.  Zero actaul moderating, no real-time fact-checking, or push back in any way. about the counltess lies and presonal insults...this also serves as another black eye for our image and credibility abroad. Don;t think I can sit through another one of these, it really does a terrible disservice when the mainstream media continues to give a microphone to those promoting to end our democracy, especially after already having tried to seize power and prevent the lawful transfer of power, with plans to do it again (in case he loses yet again) and yet the media give Trump all the airtime his heart desires."

823,I go with Trump
824,"Look. I&#39;m not from The USA. But, seriously is this the best 2 candidates that you can come up with. You have got one maniac who wants to cut taxes on the mega rich, when he has inflation, and this tax cut will only spur inflation. He also doesn&#39;t accept the election outcome. If he had a credible opponent surely he would lose. Obama would have beaten him in a landslide..<br><br>Then you have a current President who seems to old and has to many senior citizen moments. He is fumbling answers, which makes him sound inept. He is fumbling his answers. He seems sadly like he is getting dementia. He looks tired.. Really he should not run for re-election."

838,Speechless
839,"New world debate but what i really don&#39;t like them, is that, they read a script that not from there real mouth talk TF boring show<br><br>But for Trump i can feels his talk feels real talk from his mouth"
840,"If you give me a time stamp, I&#39;ll do my best to explain and identify any logical fallacy or lie taking place in that time stamp and give sources for either president."
841,"Hey genius your orange opponent didn’t ship out the silicon jobs. That ship sailed well before Trump even thought of being the president. Even if they brought back those jobs tomorrow, who’d fill those job positions? Who’s qualified for those jobs? Who’s even seeking education in those fields?"
842,"Trump please answer one question ❓⁉️ you keep repeating money to border, to foreign country,downing Biden again, and again  as loser what Biden calls you!  This is a debate only!"
843,Pelosi and Obummet and company archestated January 6th. All made up period!
844,Seriously I just wish when I had debates like this I’m from Australia and they do the same thing I really just wish they had to provide proof for every argument they put across when you do university or TAFE If you make a statement you have to provide proof that that statement is true.
845,How much cocaine did Biden do prior to this debate?
846,...and by the way.....lol....Biden phrase
847,"has he ever had a job before, he’s lived off the people his whole life"
848,"1 hour 12 minutes in so far, Trump is lying and his only point is the border. Whereas Biden actually seems to know what he&#39;s talking about. Obviously Biden is not a great public speaker and that&#39;s clear here. But it&#39;s obvious who is the better person and better candidate."
849,Seriously  murders has got nothing to do with the legal immigrants. It’s going to happen either way with them whether it’s a family member friend or some stranger that you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time.
850,When biden talk trump 🤨<br><br>When Trump talk biden 😯
851,How many here are switching parties
852,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1930"">32:10</a>  ( calls poland &quot;poles&quot;)  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1950"">32:30</a> --- Transcript edited to say Poland and Belarus. Yet biden CLEARLY just called poland &quot;poles&quot; which is a racial slur, as well as not even being capable of pronouncing belarus. &quot;balors&quot;<br><br>Way to edit the Closed captions NBC. You don&#39;t get to just change what the president says on CC after he just called poland &quot;poles&quot;<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=719"">11:59</a>   Is biden wearing a fake ear?"
853,It’s funny how a free and fair debate gets more viewers than the phobic left.

857,"We can see your big heart Mr. Biden! You have done so much for this nation, we appreciate you so much but I think it is time for your retirement, spend time with your family and be happy. <br>Trump: Make us a favor and go play golf and leave America alone. We need young people in the government please."
858,❤❤❤❤❤
859,They both attacking each other with the expense of the farewell with American people and the democracy
860,Not really much of a debate.
861,"HEY WHO ELSE HAS WATCHED THIS AND, FAST FOWARD WHEN ALIEN 👽 BIDEN SPEAKS AND STOP PRESS PLAY WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAKS?"
862,Biden even called black children roaches on the stage and that&#39;s a fact. That&#39;s sickening and tells what he says about the black community behind closed doors
863,Smh Joe…it seems as if u are to old to be in office…everyone can see his mind CANT PROCESS his thoughts into words..the United States has turned government into the best NURSING home on the PLANET 😩😩
864,Trump 2024
865,An extra $2500 on average for food per year. Dude we are spending that nearly every 3-4 months extra. Faster than that for some people
866,"No one remembers trump lieing n lieing, n never said not one ounce of truth?? All people are focusing on President Biden. Sure he had a bad debate, about lieing craphead trump???"
867,Obama needs to let Biden retire.
868,Great medical coverage now!!!!!! Thank you Biden!❤🎉😊😊😊😊😊
869,There is nothing of substance in this debate thus far! How do both of them lean on the female draft that just passed a bill in the senate in June 2024!!!!! What about the systematic destruction of Middle Class America by outsourcing and automation of 6 figure professionals jobs!!!!!! Nothing of substance! Stop the bull$hit!
870,"How strange that there&#39;s a voice that&#39;s neither Trump nor Biden that&#39;s on one of their mics.  It goes on throughout the debate but can&#39;t make out what&#39;s said until at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=5106"">1:25:06</a> when the voice says &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot; then immediately afterward Biden says, &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot;....  Did he have an earpiece to remind him of the talking points, or worse, spitting out word for word what he&#39;s told?   Could that explain the unnatural way that Biden was speaking?"
871,We are not the most admired country in the world. Nobody thinks we are weak???? Dude half the world thinks we are weak. It’s not the military doing that it’s our soup can of a president
872,"Well, wait for the rigged election."
873,Biden needs gallons of energy drinks to get through one extended response
874,Stop raising rent yearly...
875,Trump keeps repeating about the border and money and nothing to help the economy. Stop using people of color as helping them while in office.  Why don&#39;t you try chlorine when you got COVID?
876,Personally I don&#39;t think it matters who wins. It&#39;s only a matter of time before the U.S. collapses Roman Empire style!!!
877,"This country has millions of people, yet these 2 are the best we can do for PRESIDENTS??"
878,"With absolutely no bias, Biden didn&#39;t even answer the question regarding people worried about his age, his answer was all redirected about american and not about his competence or age or ability to do the job being in his 80s... That&#39;s just concerning to not even answer the prompt."
879,Biden need to go to the church is time to leave there
880,Seriously  murders has got nothing to do with the legal immigrants. It’s going to happen either way with them whether it’s a family member friend or some stranger that you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time.
881,"Biden, you don&#39;t know what the h*** you&#39;re talking about?"
882,"I really don’t care if you like trump or not. You can’t ignore that as a country we are struggling bad. Trump, big bird, miss piggy, literally anyone would have to be better than Biden"
883,I was a drug addict during trumps presidency making 100k…I’m clean last 2 years and I’m making 175k and i struggle more with money than I did when I was addicted to cocaine….the statistics speak for themselves. I shouldn’t be struggling to make ends meet with 175k in New York
884,President Biden it’s time for you to retire.<br><br>Good luck President Trump
885,I HATE JOE BIDEN.
886,"Biden, you gotta have a ear piece in your ear. Or notes from CNN what to say."
887,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭🤣🤣🤣🤣😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
888,Theres no insulin for 15 bucks frkn liar
889,I don&#39;t think EITHER of these old white dudes are capable of leading our country and this from another old white dude LOL I say we hand over the Government to the indigionous population! They were afterall here first and I think they would act fairly and appropriately to ALL the American People!
890,When Trump said &quot;Lets not act like children&quot; is when I realized he just won the election. This was a massacre.
891,Cnn and democrats and these soft women and feminist we about to go to war what y&#39;all going to do talk trump for president
892,Trump keeps claiming what Biden did is he is talking about himself! Something is with his brain! 🧠😢
893,It&#39;s like a political version of Dumb and Dumber. 😅
894,"So why couldn&#39;t I get my son a Pell grant of 15k, I make way under 70k and my son had to get loans-not grants!  Biden needs to go..."
895,"Joe Biden, you lie what you say is What you are doing?"
896,What does he mean “they’re taking the black jobs?”  😮
897,Seriously I just wish when I had debates like this I’m from Australia and they do the same thing I really just wish they had to provide proof for every argument they put across when you do university or TAFE If you make a statement you have to provide proof that that statement is true.
898,I feel Biden was exceptionally bright and did exceptionally well <br><br>Compared to an owl
899,😂😂😂😂
900,JOE IS THE BIGGEST LIER EVER...
901,BIDEN/OBAMA LIVE TO ABORT AMERICA! 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
902,GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP
903,OLD JOE NEEDS TO GO
904,I’m done.  Morals of an alley cat!  This is a really bad debate.  And Biden is right when he said “how dare you seek retribution against any American if you get in office - that is not presidential talk!”
905,past 20 min  pewaent  20 min  future  30 min   go!
906,"You need to rest Biden! You nothing to do in this world! In your administration many war was happen, your not for Peace maker Biden, you need to resign, you are dirty old man!"
907,"America, is this really your two top “Presidential“ candidates? I’m really really embarrassed for you. 10mins of searching would find two candidates that would have better than Trump and Biden. Both, are a lonoong way from Presidential."
908,TRUMP 2024 YEAAAAHHH

911,Biden destroying the country
912,Wide open borders trump is right
913,Elections aren&#39;t decided on fact but on perception.
914,Biden stop lying
915,I’m sorry. It’s hard to watch this and get a good sense of who is the better candidate.  But one didn’t incite an insurrection. Pick your poison.
916,Trump annihilated Biden.
917,"After that debate between Biden &amp; Trump in June of 2024, I want to see Biden win, at LOSING!"
918,"While Obama was far from a perfect president, this makes me miss him like crazy."
919,"Hey Biden, it seems you are afraid to step up to Putin, but simultaneously taking away our rights to own guns? What a Communist."
920,He is destroying the country
921,The economy is worse than I have ever seen it in my 61 years. The shopping cart that was used as an example that cost $100 and then grew to $120 was bull. It costs $150 now to get what used to cost $100 not even 2 years ago.

923,We love you Trump we miss you very much. I can’t wait for your administration to run offices again. Vote for Trump
924,"BIDENS LIES!!<br><br>Biden&#39;s Claim: Biden stated that the economy was in freefall when he took office, with an unemployment rate at 15% and no jobs.<br>Fact-Check: While the economy was significantly impacted by COVID-19, the unemployment rate peaked at around 14.8% in April 2020, but it was approximately 6.3% when Biden took office in January 2021.<br>Job Creation:<br><br>Biden&#39;s Claim: Created 15,000 new jobs and 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.<br>Fact-Check: The specifics of job creation numbers can be cross-verified with the Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

925,Trump you down granted the military from your mouth. then they repeated what you said. Stop the lies! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
926,WHAT BIDDEN DID ON DAY 1 WAS THE START TO DISTROY OUR COUNTRY IF THE VOTERS KNEW  THIS WOULD HE HAVE WON THE ELECTION WELL I DONT THINK THE ELECTION WAS FAIR EITHER
927,Its amazing how Trump can say so many words without actually saying anything. It&#39;s like he&#39;s talking in sound bytes. He says millions and millions of people coming in as if it were true. Trump shows no understanding of economics.
928,"They just said no audience or studio crew who is Biden pointing at saying hi too, he you, good to see ya , hi there"
929,"What’s crazy is I got 17 hardly trained marines at a property 3 miles away from Biden’s secret Pennsylvania, home. We spying on the secret service lol"
930,"Biden Is Round Men’s!!,EVERYONE NEDS NO!!!,Mr. Biden KILLING BYTES COUNTRY UKRAIN !!!,VILLY NOT UMANN UKRAINIAN SO BYTEFUL CYTIS; TODAY LUCKING AGLOW!!!."

935,"Biden you got to apologize to America. We are coming for you. Evan once Trump gets elected. We will get you bro. We will get your wife, all your family. Everyone who worked for Biden or oboma. We coming…"
936,Trump would have won if he didn&#39;t show up and just let Joe talk. I waited patiently to open a new brokerage account well into joes term after we were slumping into recession/depression. Right around the time bidens administration CHANGED the definition of recession and depression. I bought amazing stocks at ridiculously low prices thanksto Joe destroying the supply chain and tanking the economy.
937,Cnn did a good job though i thought they were fair and professional i was thinking they would be biased
938,"Stop the.debate,he needs to rest now."
939,Honestly don&#39;t know why people are so shocked. I think Biden did good. No worse than he had been recently. One of my least favourite people but even still.
940,Mr very good brain keeps bragging he &quot;aced&quot; the basic cognition test utilized to determine the likelihood that discharging a mentally addled patient is less likely to go burn his or her own domicile down. Then Trump went &quot;home&quot; and had a ketchup throwing tantrum.
941,I&#39;d be rich if I had a nickel for every time Biden mentioned &quot;The idea..&quot; <br><br>And yet... I&#39;m still lost about what the idea is.
942,Did Biden say if he&#39;s elected he would restore Roe vs Wade? It was reversed on his watch and he&#39;s had 2 years to restore it since. He doesn&#39;t have that power.
943,Stop stu-stu-stuttering and spi-spi-spit it out sleepy joe 😴
944,And it’s not just me. I have a private Malaysia 12 months warfare training l. We are at 478 and growing lol
945,"Biden had dementia while he was running for presidency. Madness that he became president. The poor lad <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=393"">6:33</a>  can barely speak."
946,T2025
947,What a disappointment these two children are. Im voting for RFKJr!
948,"Sorry, I have a question.😊<br>What does it&#39;s mean &quot;Hispanics&quot;?<br>Trump seems to use that word, too much."

950,He looked ok at the beginning but he has no stamina
951,Trump 2024. Biden is not running this country
952,86 46
953,I don&#39;t know about that Joe it was living pretty good under Trump. Trump 2024
954,"Dont people realise that the economies of most countries are bad at the moment ????.The price of food,homelessnss, the cost of real estate all have skyrocked.Biden may be old but from afar he has done more for people than trump ever did."
955,Nothing presidential about it
956,The best part of the debate was the look on Trumps face as Biden mumbled and stumbled incoherently. It was pathetic. Now the left mainstream media is making it a small story on their broadcasts when its the biggest story in our country. Bcs they don&#39;t know how to handle this huge fiasco.
957,Oversættelse
958,Trump. ❤. Trump.
959,This hurts to watch 😵
960,STRAIGHT AWAY TRUMP LIES
961,The words &quot;Rock&quot; and &quot;A Hard Place&quot; spring to mind

977,I don’t trust Biden he never blinks! How have his eyes not dried up
978,Obama and Killington support Joe Biden because they love puppet.
979,I&#39;m having a really hard time believing anything Biden says. He has lied his entire career. He hasn&#39;t a clue. He&#39;s delusional. Blames Trump for anything bad and taking credit for things Trump did for good!! We are the laughing stock of the world. I&#39;m very proud of Trump for his calm demeanor. Biden has notes. Biden is the only president in US history that left men behind!! I&#39;ll bet you can guess who I&#39;m voting for!!
980,"Around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1087"">18:07</a> , you can hear an echo and see how Biden reacts to it smh , idk if I’m trippin but is it coming from Biden ? He looks like he’s trying concentrate on what they are saying to him , he gots an ear piece or something. Am I trippin ?"
981,Economy so great crude tanked too minus $ a barrel <br><br>Pair of a holes
982,Trump is bipolar. He accuses Biden of everything he is and does.
983,Im pretty sure Biden has Parkinsons disease.
984,Biden is near impossible to follow with anything he says 😂
985,We learned Trumps policies are amazing for all Americans and Bidens are a disaster!  We also learned that Trumps mind is still extremely sharp while Bidens is horrible.
986,Yellow dog is jackal’s brother.
987,I think Republicans and Democrats need to come together and demand better candidates. These are not the people I want representing me!
988,Wol him biden corner him
989,When steel tariffs were put on countries for dumping steel here it saved our Industry

1058,Omg I know Trumps reform on the VA was so much better than what Biden did I got a private doctor not even have to go to the VA
1059,Immigrant have been coming to this country forever. There was a time they came here to find job&#39;s to build a life for themselves and their family. Not to get paid for free. Why is abortion even a conversation? There&#39;s people out there that can&#39;t have a baby. My fellow vet&#39;s need more help than immigrants and have.  I can&#39;t stand politicians...

1066,when i see these leaders i understand America goes to end as of the leaders.
1067,Biden said he was going to raise taxes on billionaires during the last election and still hasnt done that even though he has signed more executive orders then any president in history.
1068,I can&#39;t stand Trump. I am not stupid for probably voting for him. But Biden is a  vegetable and we are doomed if he gets voted again. One word &quot;Venezuela&quot; why Trump will win. Let a cat loose cause the mice are running wild.
1069,"Joe, why do you keep stuttering?"
1070,Both of them told multiple lies in the first 10 minutes of this debate. Sad day to be an American
1071,And you’re right the war in Ukraine however the war in the UK was not our war. We should not be funding it when the American people are struggling we need a strong president. We need Trump.
1072,JOE Wake up

1082,All he could say is that he’s a liar. He’s a liar. He’s a liar. Come with some facts to back. Those lies up Biden.
1083,🤡
1084,That’s right Mr. Trump you tell him our veterans are in streets dying with nothing and there’s people in luxury hotels that aren’t even papered citizens
1085,If either one of these geriatric nuts are elected we are doomed.
1086,2044 yet?
1087,You have had 4 years to do something about the taxes Mr.  President and nothing has happened yet.  So I guess you need 4 more??  Give me a break!!

1092,They should have a live fact checker at these debates. Anyone can stand there telling lies for an hour straight its basically story telling time.
1093,Joe Biden needs to leave the White House TODAY!!
1094,when Biden is rightfully accused of a crime he answers &quot;The idea that...&quot;
1095,No they don’t respect the country and it’s because the USA has a spineless jellyfish running it. He could not put the fear in a child he is too old as well

1112,"I love you Mr, Trump."
1113,TRUMP 2024 he got my vote
1114,You are sadly mistaking if you “think” that the wealthy pay their fare share. It always ALWAYS trickles downhill! Make the wealthy company pay and the wealthy company will pass on that brilliant idea to their employees!<br>Completely stupid statement
1115,Oh my god is biden short circuiting
1116,"Omg Trump said he wants Israel to finish their job which is finishing Palestine!!<br>What a worst decision ever worse than Putin! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=2150"">35:50</a>"
1117,Why did Biden sign a bill to fund Ukraine for 12 years
1118,The Dems wanted to defund the police.  Trump supported them.
1119,Well. This decision is both easy and depressing.
1120,Trump did not decimate the economy. The bug which cannot be blamed on Trump had much to do with the economy. That and all the businesses closed because of the bug.  Biden lies again as usual
1121,"Trump won he sure did he is a Actor he won never answering one question and over 90 lies ,Yes he won as Joe was so shocked and confused that this Horrible man could lie so much in front of the world ,Biden was furious and could not get his thoughts together as he knew Trump was just lying and not answering not 1 question ,He is very wise ,Biden is no actor he is no public speaker ,He is great leader ,Trump is hateful and dangerous he showed his evil side someone who has spread more hate than we ever seen if it looks like a pig and oinks like a pig it is a pig.......Sorry Trump you sure can act but you are still a pig........."

1125,I like how they cut Biden off when he starts to make an utter fool of himself 😁
1126,"No wars when Trump was in, Ukraine, Palestine under Biden"
1127,With all the corporate tax cuts some companies still laid off workers even though they made huge profits. We have companies like John Deere laying off American workers and sending them to Mexico. US Foods corp continue layoffs and send jobs to Accenture in India. Those companies should be called out especially with the economy
1128,"&quot;Let&#39;s ignore the questions being asked, and just bicker about why my opponent is &#39;embarassing&#39; or &#39;a loser&#39;.&quot; I just love having two clowns run for president yet again"

1136,Anyone else notice that Biden seems to read from notes or teleprompter at times during the debate and still couldn’t get it right ? Trump 2024!!!!! We love Trump!!!!!
1137,Why do we have senior babies representing us for president and the GOP? Some of you mellinials and gen x and genz need to get out there and run for presidency. If we had younger people i promise we would vote for you all. We dont need these baby boomers in office. Theyre fighting like children. 😢🩵
1138,Our border isn’t even close to the most dangerous border anywhere in the world😂😂😂
1139,No it’s not been a great thing trump. Only the religious quacks opposed healthcare and women’s rights
1140,Trump 2024
1141,Religious leaders have no business in governmental decisions . Trump you are a joke. You are so wishywashy - you say what ever your base will feed into
1142,Anyone who watched the debate can and should realize just how pathetic and sickening America has become if Biden and Trump are the best we can come up with for president.  There is no hiding the facts or the truth to what America has become.
1143,"All politicians are liars, both trump and Biden don’t give a crap about the American people. For all of you watch Fox and CNN, I have disappointing news for you. Crime, the cost of living and inflation is not the result of immigration, China or Russia! How about blaming the politicians that sold you out to big corporations! How about the private bank called the Fed that prints endless money at the same time devaluing the dollar. How about our judicial branch that is bought by big money to change laws that favor corporations and not you! The American culture is the problem and not so much the immigrants, China or Russia."
1144,"Lol your party is the party trying to defund social security and Medicare.  Trump, do you even know how Medicare and social security works? You don’t get put on either unless you are paying into it. So the billions that will contribute to the failing system because of the Republican Party insistence on defunding americas safety nets"
1145,"Very impressed by Trump&#39;s ability to stay silent, didnt even mention Biden pooping his pants multiple times."

1149,"Trump is america,  the world, and the environments greatest enemy."
1150,"Trump is america,  the world, and the environments greatest enemy."
1151,I’ve voted once in my life but what Biden has done is scary and we have to get him out the office
1152,"Trump has no clue about the economy and the tariff answer shows it perfectly . Inflation was skyrocketing under trump, trump destroyed the supply chains by doing zero to improve the Covid situation. The tax cut was only for the 1 percent  it did not help América or americans"
1153,What a joke!
1154,I balive abortion should be a loud till 18 years
1155,TWO_EXPIRED_MEN_BOTH_ANMTI_PEACE_BOTH+SUPPOETERS_OF_GENICIDE!
1156,Biden is a creepy mf man i could see it in his eyes no lies
1157,What’s killing America is trumps policies. Adding tariffs to Chinese goods didn’t do anything for America other then drive the cost of goods through the roof
1158,this is why third party candidates need more attention
1159,"Why, why, why are we not “fact checking” live??? Trump does his usual rhetoric with exaggerations and lies with absolutely no proof! <br>Why is he allowed to voice personal opinion with no fact base??? This is a debate not to be personal opinion but fact based!<br>But when people hear, they think it is true. They are not fact checking because people are supposed to be honest. <br>I know it would lengthen the debates, but Trump  is just doing his regular political lies on national television. <br><br>He literally cannot prove his claims as they are lies!<br>…With mic off and to actually see, Trump with his mouth shut and not ranting and raving, interrupting and denigrating everyone he doesn’t like! <br>Wow, what a sight to be behold!👏🏻"

I truly believe covid was intentionally done to try and throw Trumps progress off. One of many reasons. Another reason i believe is to see  how many people they can decieve into fear and get them to jump to the jab for when the mark of the beast comes to see how many would bow when the time comes..which is right around the corner.  Its all conditioning and testing the waters.<br>The mark of the beast isn&#39;t just a conspiracy theory. It is literally in the process right now of being made"

1176,"These people are America&#39;s candidates? This is our choice, either dementia or stupidity?"
1177,I’m happy about the debate. It proves that Biden is a lying incompetent.
1178,Trump is the biggest liar in American history
1179,President Trump truly loves our country and its people. He doesn’t want power or money…he genuinely wants to fix our country for the people. TRUMP 2024🇺🇸
1180,Not to try to be  funny... Mr. Biden speaks  as if he&#39;s  ran 🏃‍♂️  a  marathon in  100 degree weather.... standing  still....  let him rest... he tried 😔
1181,Biden looks very sick .
1182,"Those who don&#39;t endorse him where not pandered to during their service , he is the elect to be served not his appointees."
1183,Trump 2024 🎉🎉🎉🎉
1184,Seems apparent to me a few things - 1) Trump rarely wanted to answer questions succinctly and straight on 2) Biden sounds like a great corner man for a boxer (think Mickey from Rocky).

1193,"What i can see is a ruthless gangster, making his money with criminal stuff, and has only one easy task to destroy the democracy in USA. Biden on the other Hand tries to get all facts right, takes respolibility and drives his human brain up high, in order to fulfill his task and oppose the criminal minds which want to attack him and the democracy of the usa. He has heart. Trump only says the word heart, but he thinks of the mafia gangsters in russia who want Trump to win."
1194,I want to see Pres. Bidens SLUMS score please and thank you.
1195,Biden is doing the right things despite being a raisin

1205,America better pray Trump wins. Biden sat there and allow 2 majo wars start right under this nose. If putin takes Ukraine its over.  Trump knows Putin he would have listened.

1215,"Biden has no original thoughts or ideas , he is a plagiarist and a copycat imposter to a leader."

We haven&#39;t been able to get much done because we don&#39;t have the seats to pass the laws that we need. Republicans don&#39;t want us to get anything done. My fellow Americans, give me what I need and I&#39;ll get it done. You have my word.&quot; That is all he had to say. This would only take 35 to 40 seconds. Biden should had been coached that he needs to keep his answers short, so more time can be dedicated to Trump. The more Trump talks the more opportunity Biden has to make Trump look idiotic as well as Trump making himself look idiotic. Always keep your responses under a minute if you can and allow your opponent especially if they are as much of a dingus and narcissistic as Trump to say more. <br><br>You spend more energy setting the record straight after Trump lies so you can show that are the better guy and you laugh at him whenever he responds to you saying the truth, while saying, if you can, things you know that will get under Trump&#39;s skin. <br><br> &quot;You had spent four years as President as you still don&#39;t know what a tariff is. <b>Laughs</b> That is pathetic, Trump. Sad and pathetic.&quot; <br><br>Things like that. <br><br>&quot;What is the Deep State? Really? What is it? Sounds like the Boogeyman to me? You afraid of the Boogeyman, Trump?&quot;<br><br>And if you can always hit back with the same spark that got under his skin earlier. <br><br>&quot;Donny, there is no Boogeyman. The Deep State ain&#39;t real. The federal agencies of the government are just parts of the United States of America that had made us such a great country. They are nothing to be scared of.&quot;"
1225,i feel so bad for Biden. Whoever is forcing him to keep running is evil. He actually reminds me of a close relative who have passed 🥺🥲
1226,"It&#39;s hilarious how Biden couldn&#39;t list any ways to support that America is better than other countries, besides the military 😂"
1227,Well if he would have been left alone to be the President instead of everyone trying to get him out! He did more than most while fighting for his own interests!
1228,"BIDEN IS DONE!!  As clear as sunlight, Biden is a typical politician ( over promise but can&#39;t deliver), clearly works for corporations and not for the people."
1229,"Its not good to let this old Biden to go through this lengthy debate, he is supposed to be home playing with his grand kids. He can&#39;t even speak."

1232,"It&#39;s really sad that these 2 are the best candidates these parties have to offer. This is the consequences of citizens going with the flow, refusing to question the political status quo. Trump needs Biden and Biden needs Trump. Both of their bases are scared of the other candidate.<br><br>This isn&#39;t a positive vision for our future, it&#39;s just &quot;im not him&quot;. When both are old and stupid in their own ways, that&#39;s not good enough. I refuse to believe these are the most qualified leaders in America."
1233,I would like a fact check video made on Biden’s statements.
1234,it was over before it even started! Biden should have never said a word about the taxes and inflation! Assclown!
1235,"I say we do away with voting for the President, instead we put the two of them in a boxing ring, let them go at each other, and the lastman standing is President. That&#39;s assuming Jie can make it to the ring and not fall flat on his face and knock himself out before the fight starts. 🤷"
1236,"The only way the Socialist Dems could win is to cheat. No rational American would want to vote for a bad economy, inflation and high food and gas prices."
1237,"If i was American, i would vote for Trump, maybe my english isnt good but its becouse i can understand Trump while i dont undersand half of what Biden is talking or trying to talk"
1238,Joey starts out blaming Trump for the current economic situation. Trump has not been in office for almost 4 years. That makes the current economic situation bidens responsibility. Not Trumps. He started with a lie and just kept adding to it
1239,"Trump was so patient with Biden. I think he even felt sorry for him sometimes. The World needs a different man than Biden, that’s for sure."
1240,"Democrats, you need a more coherent and qualified President elect. Biden should not run for President again."

His policies are like the wind. Just like he used to be a supporter of segregation, and now suddenly gives a  rip about blacks. His mental state aside, this guy cannot represent me because a man who stands for nothing will fall to anything."
1249,Bìden is a liar and manipulaator

1252,"WOW! I can only laugh when the current President says that the Economy was bad under Trump, what a total liar. WE were MAXED OUT on employment especially during the Holiday seasons. The company I worked for was unable to find workers! We were willing to train, all you needed to do is just show up."

1270,"So we&#39;re going to vote for Trump because he is a fluent liar, a convicted criminal, and womanizer. We sound like hypocrites as a nation of Christians. Did we not learn? So, we&#39;re essentially saying &quot;give us Barabas&quot;! Biden made his points for the country. Think folks."
1271,Trump should have shut that DEI crap down. The black and brown trump voters dont want none of that bullcrap. They aint lesser than anyone else. They dont wanna be coddled too.  They wanna work hard and earn it.  Just like everyone else wants &amp; has too. Cant believe that was even brought up.

1342,This debate is very telling. Joe Biden’s responses were largely inaccurate and many times nonsensical. People are not stupid Joe. We remember who did what and how things were. I love how Donald Trump used his time to talk and counter Joe’s BS and the traps CNN tried to lay. Donald Trump crushed Joe in this debate.
1343,Oh we’re cooked America.

1370,"(. . . - - - . . .) After this poor performance by Joe R Biden Jr. In the 2024 Presidential “debate” with former President Donald J. Trump, and now for Biden to have any chance to WIN the 2024 U S. Presidential election, Koe R. Biden Jr. needs to make the correct strategic move, to mend the country as His legacy, which is to run with Joe Manchin III, U.S. Senator, an Independent from West Virginia, as Biden&#39;s Vice President 2024 running mate. Joe Manchin, as a proven Moderate / Centrist thinker will entice the overwhelming large number of Independent Moderate Centrist thinking U.S. Voters, sitting out the 2024 election, to go vote, in November,  to elect the combined Joe R. Biden Jr. (Democrat) / Joe Manchin III (Independant) ticket. Why ? All voters know that Joe R. Biden Jr  would be handing the Presidential Office to His history making centrest, and Independent politicaly thinking V.P. Joe Manchin III soon after the 2024 Election 2024 Democratic Win. Joe Manchin III is without any question capable, “all-ready” to be a calming force often Diplomatic, Moderate, Centrist, Consensus  building, Independent President demonstrating depth of intelligence, decorum, steady on display common sense leadership that He has shown with core confidence while in the West Virginia Senate office now held. Who would not want an excellent, clear spoken likable human being with excellent communications skills aa United States President? That and so much more makes Joe Manchin III, as President, the perfect choice to work with all U.S. political parties, other Nation’s Leaders to govern, and, most important to heal a polarized United States electorate back to contented unity. In NO WAY is Kamala Harris ready to assume this task ahead, or the office of the President of the United States. Joe Robinette Biden Jr., please, please set these United States of America on a healing path ! Joe Biden……”Time to Man Up”. Make the right choice, at the right time who should better be the Country&#39;s Vice President who will make right these United States as the next U.S. President, and to the benifit of We the People within. My fellow Americans, then in 2028, when past this National debate of what should br our best forward facing identity, decide again who should be U.S. President, based on your assessment of past Joe Manchin III Presidential performance, and our then combined united agreement in such. So as you often say, Joe R. Biden Jr. , “Cut The Malarkey” of having  Kammla Harris as your 2024 Democratic V.P. running mate ! Save your Presidential legacy by taking decisive action to heal the United States by vering away from the Political Polerrzation of today deviding “We the People” with a robust Uniter named Joe Manchin III by your side now until November 2024. Why because a centrist moderate President is what the country we love needs right now, and going forward (. . . - - - . . .)            .........."

I can see that the economy was better with him around and life was easier. I&#39;m from a poor family and I&#39;m about to work my way through College, and I&#39;d prefer Trump in office so gas will be cheaper for me when I&#39;m starting off my adult life than have Biden and this crappy economy so some people can feel good inside. You don&#39;t have to like Trump he isn&#39;t meant to be your friend, he&#39;s trying to run the country, and he can clearly do that better than Biden can."

Now I am over 64 and I have no way getting help, thanks to CNN bought your attention about social security and disability action for Medicaid &amp; Medicare... Now I hear from president Donald J Trump debt how you support the migrants and give them disability plus social security benefits Free housing free Medicaid free education Plus Free housing which they are not citizen or work and pay taxes. but you will not stand by your own American citizens. Why should I believe to vote for you??? The IRS had charged me over 13,000 $$$ in Obama insurance penalty before President Trump dismissed it during his presidential. Now I am angry 😠 with your administration and your policy, but instead you offered these criminal migrants collecting all the benefits and I&#39;m left out in the dark, &amp; by working and serving my community in the past as an American citizen. Now I know better who to vote for I assure you sir will be president Donald J Trump he is right about you being a big liar. You only work for the communist China and the social party. There is no more democracy left in America you&#39;re the worst president in history of America you destroyed America. Again President Trump was right about you. I prayed to the almighty God we will never see the like of you President Joe Biden in the White House or President Obama Hussein."

1407,"Due to intimidating time constraints against anyone on the hot seat, especially for a POTUS who has a documented speech impediment, plus the need to deal with a most Malignant Narcissistic Person, on a debate stage, whether or not an audience is present, would certainly be debilitating for that person, especially up against America&#39;s newest form of intimidation, online intellectual bullying, with failure to do said fact checking, in real time, per an agreed upon set of rules, by both sides, by a so called &quot;News Reporting Channel&quot;, like some three other national TOXic Right (Wrong) Wing Newsance Channels, all with their propagandistic anomalies of non-reporting of actual news that we currently see everyday, with an ABSOLUTELY APPALLING fact that they, the MAGAt Repugnants&#39;, have sunk so low, as to obviously be supporting one male toddler candidate, who is threatening US, the United States of America, and everything she stands for in the World, is nothing short of a Declaration Of Civil War."
1408,Notice Biden never said illegals weren&#39;t getting SS benefits.
1409,I don&#39;t see nothing this administration has done for working class Americans
1410,"Biden, you are the worst president in American history... Biden is trying to take credit for things he didn&#39;t do and blaming Trump for the things he did.  America sees you for what you are. The leaders now do whatever they want regardless of what the American people want. You&#39;re all about power and money and nothing more, and you&#39;ll do anything to keep it. We, the people, see you or what you are.  Our government will not play fair. They have already showed us that.  We already know the outcome. It&#39;s not an election, it&#39;s is a show.."
1411,"Look at bidens mouth hanging open all the time, I use to see this a lot, I work at a nursing home with a dementia/Alzheimer&#39;s unit, this guy should be in slippers watching matlock."
1412,It’s about time that the Dems admitted to what we all knew about Joe’s mental capacity.  I guess they couldn’t hide it any longer.
1413,Both adults not answering the questions both just blaming each other.  Why can&#39;t theyvjst answer what we want yo hear and borvblame each other? Like Children arguing.  Answer the questions i expected more. This was just horrible. Very few questions actually answered.
1414,"Biden literally just said,  the people who earned their money was going to get a 24% tax to fix a problem he caused and is blaming someone else for. <br><br>Lol you can&#39;t make this up"
1415,&quot;You are a sucker&quot; - this is unworthy for a President
1416,Nice
1417,"Thas all they talk usa is a state brat , goverments are only good for war like irak vietnam or ww2 , i barely wacht politics , markets , family , religion , art , mysterie , is all a normal person needs"
1418,TRUMP 🙌
1419,America make una no vex I pity all of una
1420,Why are they allowed to run for president
1421,Government doesn’t care about fair taxes.
1422,So they are both saying that they have done the most for veterans in history it&#39;s a fact someone&#39;s lying😂😂😂
1423,Presidential Debates are now the new “Stories” our grandma would have on when go visit 😂 gotta change that channel
1424,Watching Joe biden makes me believe anyone can be a president even me actually. Someone please tell me how he was elected in the first place. It&#39;s a clown 🤡 world we live in
1425,"-last year of Trump...Walmart brand lactose tablets...$4 for 120 count<br>-2nd year of biden same exact brand, same exact store..over $8 BUT for 80 count<br><br>oh but joe says...&quot;everything is okay&#39;&#39;....well gee i guess it is, i&#39;ll just go back sitting in the corner; eating my buggers"
1426,"We are not as powerful as Biden says. Biden is lying. If so, what’s a draft for"
1427,Why when he gave trump his intro we thought he never introduced Biden 😂
1428,Just like an Article written for no one under the age 35 can be the President a new article needs to be written that no one over the age of 70 can be the President
1429,Israel maids
1430,Trump gonna clean house! Pwriod !😂😂
1431,Tax is not fair. No tax our government should pay us
1432,who&#39;s running the country not biden we&#39;ve all seen this are your eye&#39;s just catching up three years of this are you so brain dead you believe them and not yor lying eye&#39;s im so sad people are not aware of their surroundings
1433,If humiliation were a person!
1434,BIDEN IS A LIVING LIE.
1435,"I love the fact that CNN , NBC etc aired this.  Now their viewers have to believe their eyes.  No hiding.  It&#39;s right there with the veil off<br>If you have a thousand billionaires and say they have an average of 2 billion.....and you confiscated it all ...100% tax (2 trillion total) you would fund the debt for 200 days. You can&#39;t tax us out of this.  You can always spend faster than you can earn."
1436,What was the purpose of january 6th? Because the election was rigged and people were protesting.
1437,This is absurd and unacceptable. America desperately needs better choices for the holder of the highest office in the country.  Theres too many lives at stake for  this drivel.
1438,"Biden got to go to the nursing home. A poilot, a bus driver gets retired on age of 60 to 65.  Why Biden is still making decision for the people of  this greatest nation 🇺🇸? He&quot;s just got to go!"
1439,Here&#39;s what probably happened:    Biden was scared going into the debate and having to face Trump.  That&#39;s why he turned white and could barely talk!!!   Everyone is making other excuses for what happened.  And then right after the debate he spoke to a crowd of followers in the Carolinas!  Back to normal 😮
1440,Trump ended very strong. Maybe I should just say he&#39;s jacked up or coked up? What&#39;d Trump&#39;s handlers give Trump?... And can they plz share some with Biden ffs?
1441,"Blame Jill, Nancy and Chuck. No reason a man this age should get rolled out there like this."
1442,"What we know is that a lotta people want trump to be president because he reflects who most Americans are , liars , cheat on all of your spouse , have children out of wedlock , file bankrupt many times , steal whatever he can and brag about being the best and perfect at everything . That’s the message to send to the world ."
1443,Donald trump 2024 🎉🎉🎉🎉
1444,"IMO President Biden looks confused, feeble, and medicated.  It&#39;s like he has some cognitive issues.  Goodness.  He needs to step down NOW."
1445,I got turned down for insurance.  I take medicine that keeps me alive. I hope ill be around to vote.
1446,Not surprised Biden is sleeping on the job every day !
1447,I would like to see verified unbiased fact checked documentation on every single statement that they make!
1448,Trump 2024❤
1449,"Honorable gentlemen, them two cousins are the best friends in this planer. God filled of more wisdom Amen."
1450,Biden is full of crap😊!!
1451,Trump is great
1452,Does Biden&#39;s voice make anyone else&#39;s skin crawl? 🤔  no shade either
1453,"Does anyone answer questions anymore.....so what will u do about the clean air? Well I think he was the worse president and the borders are so bad and Putin is laughing....it&#39;s like saying things that make u say hmmmm! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23arseniohallshow"">#ArsenioHallShow</a>. Yes Putin is laughing at both of u n so am I 😂"
1454,Joe has lost the ability to use body language..its just gone from his brain... His brain just can&#39;t express itself on a physical level
1455,How can this even be called a presidential debate? It&#39;s run by a biased corporation. CNN is such a sham.
1456,How absolutely abysmally embarrassing
1457,"I&#39;ve watched this at least three times. I am so proud of Trump. There was moments where he could have really shredded Biden, but he didn&#39;t. He showed empathy, and self control but told the facts. Such a great man."
1458,Biden is quite incoherent.<br>Trump is more articulate.
1459,Biden has messed America up! I make more money in my life now than ever before and still struggle. When Trump was in office I could save a little money than and pay my bills. Now I can&#39;t even save. I lost my health insurance can&#39;t afford it. Biden is the end let him go America!
1460,Can anyone tell me what biden has done besides make stuff more expensive  by devauling the dollar and give Ukrainian  billions ?
1461,It’s time for Biden to go.
1462,Biden is the biggest liar i ever saw
1463,Dose anyone else here get the sinking feeling that no matter how many votes Trump gets Biden still gonna win?
1464,The amount of times he went “the idea” “one… two…”
1465,Why is Braindead reading off of notes? Wasn’t that one of the rules? No notes.
1466,Biden is like talking about a dream he had 😂😂😂😂😂
1467,"&quot;Biden is far beyond cogent. He is better than he has EVER been intellectually, analytically. He is the best ever.&quot;- Joe Scarborough of MSNBS"
1468,Biden telling lies on lies is funny to me biggest 🧢 EVER
1469,Take a good hard look all of those who did vote for Biden. Not just in this debate. But what effect corruption has when in charge of the U.S.  People are hurting in many ways. Some dying due to the illegals coming in. Don’t feel guilt anymore about voting for Biden. I don’t believe you voted him in anyway. I believe the election in many ways was corrupt. Simply just don’t think someone like this should be in charge ever again. Who cares what party. Just support those that try to prove themselves as sacrificially as possible
1470,BIDEN HAS THE LOOK OF A CRIMINAL. LOOK AT HIS DIM.ENTED FACE
1471,"Ukraine must be defended and be part of NATO, Ukraine will gladly host NATO navy in the black sea too, if Ukraine is in NATO that means NATO ships are in the black sea, HUGE asset to NATO alliance."
1472,"Wow! The fact that people voted for Biden and still back him up, is crazy! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamtrump"">#teamTrump</a>"
1473,Just wow
1474,I really hope Trump becomes president again 😮‍💨. Life will be so much easier
1475,The question for childcare was COMPLETELY IGNORED BY BOTH this is just another economic debate.
1476,"Biden really got it out there, that&#39;s even more lopsided than their second debate"
1477,"you put a man who was in office just before covid, [talk about a parting gift, ] we fought covid without him and now he is in office again and we have more problems and are more in debt now after removing most of our debt before this man returned and we are in terrible fear of war like never before because now today it is more dangerous in terms of nuclear power. Oh Most High help us all"
1478,My thoughts goes to the person in charge of the transcript of Biden&#39;s speechs!
1479,Joe Biden is a war criminal in excess of Putin.
1480,What mask has he on? Been doing it for years
1481,No me gusta su cadena (por comunista) y Trump ganó por goleada…😘
1482,HOW ABOUT VOTING FOR MICHELLE OBAMA
1483,It is so sad that these are the choices we have. Something has to change.
1484,Oh my this is..this is bad
1485,"No comparison, trump 2024 🇺🇸"
1486,"This is terrifying. No matter who wins, the next four years are going to be terrifying. Neither one truly answered a single question. This is supposed to be about our future but instead they are fighting about who’s better at golf. Both these fools need to retire and step aside, they make us look like a joke."
1487,Biden got his handicap down to a 6? Maybe i should vote Democrat? 😂😂😂
1488,Very true president Trump Joe Biden is going to get us into World War III
1489,I was doing great under Trump as middle class
1490,&quot;Thankyou President Trump&quot;- CNN knows who the current president is right? Or has CNN made up their minds as who they want? Seems like it from how they conducted this sh!tshow
1491,Whu is Biden reading notes?
1492,Once a lier always a lier
1493,"Joe is old, and it is a little hard for him to splurge fast at this age, but given time he would have articulated his thoughts much better, the interview needed to be adjusted for that and given an extra minute for full articulation. Still every time Joe was able to call out Trump&#39;s lies, Trump continues to openly lie and this is why he wont be getting my vote. I am a conservative too."
1494,Trump did better than I thought he would have but I don&#39;t think id vote for him yet honestly lol just my opinion
1495,"This is too much in the man,he is past his bedtime"
1496,I dont know politics but i never felt I NEEDED a rifle as bad as i did this past year. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1497,"Biden, you are the worse , the worse president ever"
1498,"As a person from China, I have personally experienced the destruction of human nature by the Chinese social system. I know the dangers of the Communist Party. What worries me is that neither candidate has a sufficient sense of the crisis. President Trump’s views on Russia and North Korea are naive and dangerous, and President Biden’s handling of immigration issues is also very dangerous, which has also led to a crisis in the free world."
1499,Biden is now ahead in the polls simply for telling the truth. Wow! Thank you America🙏🇱🇷🙏Freedom
1500,Biden waĺks like an old man
1501,Did anyone else only get bored when Biden was talking?
1502,President Biden is blind he doesn&#39;t see what&#39;s going on
1503,What an absolute sh!tshow.
1504,Only God can change the climate! We need to stop dumping in our oceans We are destroying climate
1505,Time to go to Europe or sum
1506,When someone starts swearing or saying facts are &quot;lies&quot; that&#39;s when you know they lost. TRUMP 2024!
1507,Let&#39;s go trump
1508,Biden created covid especially to destroy Trump&#39;s wonderful economy. Then blames him for it.
1509,YOU&#39;RE ALSO A LIAR ABOUT COPS BIDEN YOU TRIED TO DEFUND THE POLICE!
1510,Biden you&#39;re a liar on inflation!
1511,Biden is the worse
1512,WOW! You Americans really voted biden in? It takes one like biden to vote for him. I thought America was in the state of degeneracy but now I know they are. All I can say is OH MY!!!! OH MY!!!!! HOW SAD!!!!!
1513,"Oh my , Biden you were left with the best economy ever and you killed it."
1514,Pic kelly clar
1515,We need to have the students pay back their loan President Biden took that away and made the inflation worse
1516,"Man the more I watch trump talk, the more convinced I am that sketch is his son ☝🏽” Brother”."
1517,Inflation down cause it to go down because he is giving away you don&#39;t have to pay back the the death for the we&#39;re going to school
1518,biden is a punk
1519,I’ll take Old over Evil! 👿 🤡 Any Day! 😮😊
1520,CNN think they slick
1521,That&#39;s not true what Ben said about the black communities when when President Trump was in there was more black people that had employment then under President Biden
1522,Military and vets went back in the doghouse on the Biden admin. we had choice to choose non VA health care and were getting better under Trump admin. now were in the dumps again waiting to get better.
1523,Agenda 21  Pelosi speech 1992 for UN. Look it up!
1524,And also the voting the voting of the last time and biting got in to be president that voting was rigged
1525,I agree with President Trump there&#39;s nothing to do the debate because Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of America
1526,Ok I am totally torn between both of them😢 but they didn’t turn off microphone when it was the next person turn ( talking) The answer to childcare and Fentanyl was not answer ( to me) I wanted to hear more answers instead of attacking each other. ( save that for the campaign ads) I kind of like how the lady bought the question back but at the end I was not completely satisfied. No one perfect we are all humans. We all as Americans need some kind of relief at this point
1527,Can anyone understand the words coming out of this fools mouth?
1528,Second-hand embarrassment on y&#39;all&#39;s behalf
1529,I could drink a bottle of whiskey and still be more coherent than Biden
1530,Team Biden 0. Team Trump won
1531,Why thebdck sre we giving ny money to them anyway?
1532,WHY ARE WE IMPORTING FOOD WE CAN GROW OURSELVES!!!

1534,Bidens given two hundred billion to ukraine..and nothing..still going in
1535,"What an embarrassment, can we just start over already good god"
1536,So Biden will approve the unconstitutional “pRoJeCt 2035” but if we vote for trump he’d basically do the same thing. Can we just not vote instead- like..why these two..?
1537,I dont want either of them. Both are genocide promoters enablers perpetrators
1538,"This guy is trying to tell me It only cost an extra $20 to get groceries.  <br>  All of my bills have doubled.<br>The price of food has gone up,. My rent jumped up to the same price as a mortgage. <br>Gas, electricity, intrest rates everything across the board is terrible under Obiden"
1539,What a mess.Good Lord!
1540,These debates are done because entertainment is what it’s all about now this creates ppl to snip it make skits on comedy shows thing is they do it so that people are by entertaining ppl and doesn’t have to be beneficial just has to catch your attention so when one gets elected so many already got there hands up the  puppet that’s what that position is
1541,Facts matter Biden seems to forget the FACTS he must think all people are a uninformed as his supporters
1542,"I do personally believe , that Trump would bring peace to the world! If Biden is being elected, we got a very high chance for a nuclear conflict which would literally wipe out the human race ! Have it all this in consideration guys"
1543,"Why doesn’t Bush, Obama and Biden being brought to justice for their war crimes ?"
1544,Thers is no lice audience and we control the broadcast.

1552,How do you want to take money from the billionaires that they work hard for that’s their money it’s like playing Robin Hood really<br>Where is all our taxes going that we pay three and four taxes for order? Where is all that money going?
1553,I want to see the Biden debrief
1554,If half as much time was spent actually answering legitimate questions as was spent on personal attacks it may have been a political debate.
1555,Children and elderly adults should not have to pay for medicine where children are innocent and cannot afford to pay for what elderly adults have put in enough of work to not have to pay for medicine. Their body is a weak and their fall back to the children’s stage in life.
1556,"In my eyes, it is so simple if you’re gonna raise prices, simply give people the money to afford the prices. If not simply give people the money to get out of debt in enough to get ahead then drive down the prices. We have a money machine that runs 24 seven money should not be an issue in America. But yet is the biggest issue."

1560,Joe 🟦🟦
1561,America has the largest external debt of any country in the history of humanity.
1562,🇺🇸TRUMP2024🇺🇸
1563,Biden. Worst president ever. And everyone globally knows it.
1564,Joe’s logic and language has improved a lot
1565,I don&#39;t believe in that rip the baby out on the 9th month
1566,"This debate was awful! These two sounded  like two elementary  school boys who were arguing about who his better than who.  Biden truly is on his last legs, but what disturbs me was that there were  many    questions posed to Trump, and he never answered them. He spent more time trying to discredit Biden. I think the moderaters needed to press him to stick to the  questions being posed until he answered them, instead of deflecting by constantly  talking about Biden. This was hugely disappointing.  I was not impressed  by either of them. The only person that can truly help America right now is: Yah/ God himself."
1567,"With dirty money, Biden and company continue to fund lawfare to wear down President Trump. During the debate, Americans witnessed a strong, respected American President, stand tall and strong with the promise to revive America. <br><br>What Biden said about taxes is dead wrong. I paid more than I ever have (over double)!  And don&#39;t forget, he publically said he wanted to do away with independent contractors (small businesses)!  <br><br>Biden has been acting like a modern-day Robinhood by taking money from the rich and the middle class to fund dead-end causes.<br> <br>THINK ABOUT THIS: How is it that Biden&#39;s government officials and other political actors behind the scenes have made absolute fortunes? !!"
1568,"Trump, I mean the American people kicked butt once again"
1569,He has no empathy. He has said nothing about Gaza. It&#39;s macabre. Rather have trump
1570,Trump is like &quot;I planned taxes for an unplanned pandemic&quot; at minute 9... yeah.. that checks out?
1571,Is it $15 or $35?
1572,"They had it planned long ago Hillary and probably Newsom. Hillary for sure. That&#39;s why Assange was released.<br><br>It&#39;s all theater. They are scratching their heads &quot;who can replace Joe??&quot; They go down the list but darnit nobody seems to fit. Just watch.. suddenly there will be an explosion of realization. A eureka moment as they remember poor forgotten Hillary. She will be the savior. She will have already campaigned. People know her. To save democracy Hillary will reluctantly and humbly come out of her comfortable retirement. What a gal !<br><br>What a gal.<br><br><br>They knew it would be Hillary long ago. She didn&#39;t want a long campaign. She didn&#39;t want to have to answer questions about Seth Rich.<br><br>Solution?<br><br>1. Wait as long as possible to enter the race, just prior to the Democrat convention.<br><br>2. Release Assange so he can be s******d.<br><br>They cut a deal with Assange because Hillary is going to replace Biden and she wasn&#39;t going to run without the Assange problem solved.<br><br>Assange is in a lot of danger because Hillary is a m******r. Assange is no longer protected like he was at the embassy. Now they can get to him.<br><br>.."
1573,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=4310"">1:11:50</a> listen after &quot;It&#39;s too much money&quot; 💩"
1574,"Where are all the &quot;Fact Checkers&quot; on Bidens claims? Trump gets &quot;Fact Checked like nobody&#39;s business. Biden lied from his first statement &quot;No U.S. service members died overseas&quot;. Such disregard for the suicide bomber victims in Afghanistan. From there Biden continued to lie about EVERYTHING. Trump wasn&#39;t exactly honest either, but the &quot;Fact Checkers&quot; were on him like green on grass."
1575,I feel so sorry for Biden in this you can tell he&#39;s so stressed and on top of that we put him in the same room as that physo
1576,Image 68 every year it is going up higher and higher on the Medicare I&#39;m retired I can&#39;t work again
1577,The border patrol officers said they can barely sleep at night knowing the people they have let in to our communities
1578,Biden asked too much like a robot he moves naturally but look at his face
1579,Roe v wade: bidens right on that one.

1584,They wanted Joe to fail so he will drop out and Michael Obama will be the last minute choice! 20 million Illegals are already filling out ballots...
1585,There&#39;s still gas up high on a present Biden
1586,"Are there pious, responsible, just and peace-loving top leaders? Today in the world? When they suppress their own people and invade and colonize and affront other peoples?"
1587,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=965"">16:05</a> so how do you account for the thousands of missing indigenous women who have gone missong over the years no matter whos in office? Or the other women who are murdered at random or by their significant others? Try starting at home first before blaming outside factors for everything eh?"
1588,"After this s... show, think Biden will be the nominee?"
1589,It sounds like Joe Biden is scared of the debate since there&#39;s no one there to ask questions Joe Biden and Scooby he doesn&#39;t have questions
1590,"You people do know that you don&#39;t have to vote for either of these two guys. But, puppets are designed to have their strings pulled, I guess."
1591,Where&#39;s RFK Jr?
1592,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=822"">13:42</a> is Joe ok"
1593,Neither should be president prove me wrong. I don&#39;t want to vote corporate greed or vote for a sleeping puppet for policy writers. I want to vote for a stand up citizen with good morals and the truly cares for the people with enough wits to help guide us through this economy and our shady government rule
1594,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1035"">17:15</a> Biden wanted to sniff her hair so bad"
1595,Biden is weak
1596,We only pay 6% for our tax deduction from our pay? He said every week we pay 6% of our income. No that&#39;s sells tax Evey week 25% of our pays are gona
1597,Ever since the Obama administration has been in office there&#39;s been nothing but 5 year olds running the White House

1600,"President Donald Trump, You were all among right!! The country has been taken over by anarchists and 3 million have been illegally immigrated and are kept in 5* hotels... We are going to choose you as our president and chuck all those illegals out of US..."
1601,"this settles the debate. if not, i recon its rigged boys icl"
1602,VOTING FOR DECEASED GEORGE CARLIN
1603,Everyone can see and feel it.Inflation is hitting everyone hard. Especially because of all the money being taken from us to pay for people who criminally came into this country
1604,Trump💯‼️ common sense
1605,Good that Biden still remember that he is in a debate
1606,Neither one of the two
1607,CNN is corrupt
1608,Trump is the better option!!! It’s for the better good of the us. Vote trump!!!
1609,"Did you just say INCREASE on child care. YOU have lost it and talk out both sides of your mouth. God please get rid of this man, just put him in a nursing home and fix his room as the OVAL Office, He will not know the difference, I promise you that."
1610,Biden team should never have let him do this debate Trump ate him alive
1611,"The fact that biden needed all his rules was a mistake,  makes him look even weaker."
1612,"They&#39;re both too old to be president, but nobody wants to talk about that"
1613,When Biden took office around the time they shut down jobs have everyone sit at home because of covid that had nothing to do with how trump ran the country wake up people but that blame on Trump he opened more factories and businesses lowering the unemployment rate big time then they come in shut down the country in make people stay home in not work come on
1614,"I would rather have a Political GEEK in office than Biden, Anybody but Biden please. Please Please! He is so very lost. I mean ANYBODY but mumbling Joe. God please help us."
1615,I’m a Canadian and I’m so sorry this is what you’re dealing with. I pray Trump gets in again
1616,Trump is a perfect example of what good a young wife can do.
1617,YES!! Pull out of NATO!! Immediately
1618,and i believe they shouldnt be bullying each other either they need to talk about way more important things
1619,"Whatever they gave him to get him to not fall, fumble, mumble, I wish they would have given him some truth sereum too. Amazing he is opposite of what he normally is. Patriots are not stupid. Who is really behind that mask? His brother again? Biden&#39;s niece&#39;s dad? There&#39;s no way that that is Biden behind that mask. In reality, Biden&#39;s mind is so bad, he can&#39;t know much of anything what he is saying, which is lies."
1620,i feel a little empathetic towards biden he shouldnt be here. he is too old for this. im not saying he is a great president but he shouldn’t be president and he needs help.
1621,"Billions in the DEMO, pockets . You people have more time off work than you do in the office. No wonder nothing is getting done, just getting worst! Biden is OUT for me."
1622,Biden is the only president to not have troops killed over seas? I call BS say that to all the families who have never seen their loved ones again due to your abrupt withdraw from the Middle East!! TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS BIDEN<br><br>YOU CAUSED OUR ECONOMY TO FALL. YOU WERE IN CHARGE DURING THE PANDEMIC NOT TRUMP. OUR TRUE PRESIDENT WAS ONLY IN CHARGE OF THE PANDEMIC FOR 8 or 9 MONTHS
1623,The reaction of Biden is giving me joy here oooo
1624,Biden has destroyed so many families lives and are country and they set it up to look bad against the patriots on Jan 6th bidens administration did the damage on Jan 6th as they ordered the police to stand there and do nothing and to make Trump look bad wake up people
1625,"So no answers about childcare?? This was so frustrating. Not about the ppl , this was just an old off/cat fight<br>Can we have better moderation?????"
1626,biden is a dope
1627,Biden looks like a walking corpse. Just sad. But thats exactly what the system wants. Someone who can be easily controlled
1628,We are the laughing stock of the world since Sleepy Joe took office.
1629,Dude you can tell Joe Biden is not fit for president every time he speaks he looks so constipated like all he can think about is taking a bathroom break
1630,K-pop dancing
1631,Biden was so doped up he didn&#39;t even know where he was at.
1632,oh so we only have 2 options
1633,Vote Master Chief 2024!!!
1634,"The First things Biden are talking about, he&#39;s been talking about for years and nothing has changed.  What a Joke. I am voting for the &quot; Criminal &quot; !!!"
1635,And questions about child care and several other debate questions...deflected by BOTH sides. Spin doctors everywhere.
1636,We all have seen the results under both presidencies... its a no brainer... we need president  Trump back.
1637,"Joe needs prayer not presidency!<br>Hes evil and unfit to drive ,so running a country,is easier?<br>🙏"
1638,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=202"">3:22</a>"
1639,Make America great <br><br>We support Donald Trump 2024
1640,Joe Biden is the crook !!
1641,I couldnt even understand half of what biden said i heard more jibberish coming out of his mouth more than anything.
1642,My life was a lot better financially for many years until Biden became a president.
1643,Biden is handicapped
1644,Joe Biden is a robot 🤖
1645,They are both awful one is s lying racist psychopath <br>Another can barely form a clear sentence
1646,"Biden has Turned a COLD shoulder to ISRAEL. Remember That. This Current President has Sent our relations with the REST of the World ….Backwards.  A true Tool for the Democrats Agenda. Pelosi, Soros, Schumer and all the Elite that Want USA neutered."
1647,Donald Trump certainly has created jobs- for fact checkers.
1648,Biden has destroyed everything he has touched
1649,"Making SSI solvent is easy stop giving it to people who didn&#39;t contribute a dime (Illegal Immigrants) also, get Congress&#39;s greedy paws off of it."
1650,Biden: Closing statement; wants to Hold the Carrot in front of people to lower taxes; while he has driven up inflation over 20 %. Sorry but American People are Fed up With this type of “Shell Game”.  Biden Administration has been Dreadful.
1651,Illegals ran this country
1652,Trump2024❤❤❤❤
1653,😂😂😂😂
1654,Ppl and politics are crazy yall
1655,Biden can&#39;t even complete a full sentence
1656,Biden&#39;s also allowing these immigrants to join our military. Tf 🤦🏾‍♀️
1657,Arrogant dems needs to regroup renew or start listening to majority of peoples voice.

1660,Lol 10k tax creadit is supposed to make houses affordable?
1661,I have to close my eyes to like try to understand Biden....omg
1662,"the idea. 🙄 at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=4240"">1:10:40</a> or so Biden mentions Trump made no contact with China? umm would that not be the current president&#39;s job? 🤔"
1663,How is Biden still the president
1664,RFK RFK RFK RFK RFK RFK RFK RFK RFK RFK RFK
1665,the one who says that’s a lie every time he speaks is usually a liar food for thought
1666,Now I’ve always been moderate leaning more blue since I’m from California. But never having been to a watch party &amp; really interacted with the other side so I found myself laughing along with a crowd of Trump supporters at an event while visiting Texas.
1667,"These comments talking about Biden looks and his speech and what not, not addressing the fact that trump for a hour and a half talked around every question asked only to then answer them with a LIE. Republican or democrat this is not good."
1668,"Hands up all those who noted the error in the printed intro on screen numeric error of the number  President USA, the current president numbered as 44th, followed by his predecessor, no 45. America in YouTube is in reverse."
1669,Whoa whoa now!! War equal profit for defense contracts that’s why we send money to Ukraine so they can buy weapons from American companies like Lockheed and more!!!
1670,"All I know is, I&#39;m not looking for a &quot;perfect&quot; president who I agree with on every issue. And I certainly will NOT be voting for an individual president. Instead, I will be voting for an entire administration, 1000 people or more, who love our country, uphold democracy and the rule of law, exhibit decency and respect, oppose facism, work hard and get things done, and aren&#39;t just in it for attention, drama, and social media clicks. When I vote, I will be keeping in mind, not simply the blunders of ONE debate, but the facts of how our government actually works, the beauty of the checks and balances of our 3 branches of government, the fact that an elected president CANNOT be an all-powerful dictator (not yet anyway). I&#39;ll be keeping in mind which administration&#39;s policies promote civil rights and liberties for ALL citizens versus trying desperately to strip rights away from anyone who doesn&#39;t fit a certain mold or hold a certain religious belief. I&#39;ll be considering which administration or which party understands the importance of SEPARATION of church and state. I couldn&#39;t care less who &quot;won&quot; or &quot;lost&quot; one debate. One 90-minute snapshot in time does not negate everything that has happened over the past 8 years. I watch people&#39;s actions, their behavior, the way they treat one another. Talk is cheap. And LIES are despicable!!!  Winning a war of words doesn&#39;t make someone right for the job. Why are we so shallow, superficial, and uneducated? The world is watching. I&#39;ve been traveling throughout Europe for the past 2 months, and everyone with whom I&#39;ve had any significant conversation that has turned to politics is just flabbergasted by our collective ignorance, arrogance, and blind party loyalty. And they&#39;re not wrong. We value drama over substance. Entertainment and sensationalism over rational thought. Social media clickbait over facts. Tribal loyalty over morality. We live in our insulated little echo chambers and value party over principle. That&#39;s what&#39;s truly embarrassing about us. The Europeans with whom I&#39;ve had these conversations are encouraged to learn that there are actually millions of people like me in the U.S., we just don&#39;t get any media attention because the media likes to focus on what brings the most drama. I hope my comment encourages some of you are who are feeling hopeless. There are SO many good people who are going to do the right thing in November. People who love country over party affiliation. People who still love democracy and want to preserve it for future generations."
1671,President Thrump didn&#39;t answer two major questions......
1672,RIP Biden
1673,WE LOVE PRESIDENT BIDEN HE SUCH A GENTLEMAN THE WAY HE TALKED HUS GESTURE VERU PILIRE MAN NEVER SAY AGAINST HIS  OPPENENT BAD COMENTS CHERRE MR PREIDENT BIDEN WAY TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN
1674,I dont want Biden to win but its still sad to see someone&#39;s mental decline so bad.
1675,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=622"">10:22</a> Biden says he’s going to fix the tax system.<br>Yeah sure sure, he’s already fixing it. Inflation is so outrageously high people can’t afford to eat, or pay for housing.<br>Maybe he hasn’t noticed how he’s fixing the tax system but California has more people sleeping outside than inside.<br><br>The tax system is fixed. <br>Good job."
1676,"He had a cold. Understandable. At least there was substance with what he said. Trump never answered a question. Just babbled-he’s just as old as Biden but crazy,mean,immoral,narcissistic, crazy, incompetent, whoremonger, criminal, hypocritical, delusional etc…..just a bad human being."
1677,Take a shot every time Rumper-dump said &quot;in the history of our country&quot;
1678,"Trump actually  gaslighted Biden the whole time within this &quot;debate&quot; . It wasn&#39;t a debate, it was a nationwide broadcasted narcissistic abuse and Biden kept his cool  extremely well. I doubt that a 40 year  younger  candidate would perform better in a similar situation under such a pressure. According to Trump, immigrants are responsible for every crime in the  USA.Trump blatantly lied just to provoke Biden; that&#39;s  reactive abuse.  And this &quot;Shield&quot; on which he wants to spend money on will only  lead to banktrupcy. Just lame..."
1679,“The only existential threat to humanity is climate change.” (Biden) Is it hard to hear or understand a concise sentence?
1680,The cognitive decline 😅 is here…
1681,"I would rather vote for Nicki. Haley <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23haley4office"">#haley4office</a>"
1682,Biden 🤡👎
1683,The current President is out of touch with the people
1684,"The Democrats will cheat the election again, so what&#39;s the point of this debate."
1685,i vote for president trump any day
1686,Traum best wishes
1687,Trump everyone knows the talk hoists most be against you but America is with u trump 2024
1688,Even Jill is voting for Trump now!
1689,"Yay Trump! I don’t speak politic but I do speak gas prices. I remember gassing up at $1.25 a gallon! Please please please do that again, Trump!"
1690,Imagine you have to hit the golf ball the furthest to be president lol a driving contest??😂😂
1691,"Maybe if we allowed abortions we would not have so many families on welfare!!! Let the woman decide!!! It’s no ones decision but the mother, everyone else’s opinion means NOTHING!!!"
1692,Eau de toilette
1693,Biden to Trump: “You don’t even have the morals of an alley cat.”  A great way to sum up Trump. Biden is not feeble. He’s sharp.
1694,Trump is the man! ❤
1695,Greatest sales man ever 🤣
1696,We need Trump back please!!!
1697,Brandon&#39;s lack of metal acuity on full display.  Please dont replace Biden! He is the best hope of a Trump presidency
1698,I see dead people!!
1699,"As a Delawarean middle class woman with 3 children who voted for Biden and has been a democrat since 18 yrs old…I will be voting for Trump this year.. Side Note: I ran to the ballot to get Trump out of office in 2020, stood in line for almost 2 hours…fast forward 2024…WE NEED TRUMP BACK!!!"
1700,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=4313"">1:11:53</a>, somebody pooped themselves."
1701,"So far 13 minutes in, Trump has shown restraint, maybe forcibly. Trump looks physically healthier. Biden appears as he is, an old man. The minor lapse of Biden at end of deficit issue is not actually significant. Must be more coming since it was widely broadcast. Abortion and immigration does not work in Trump’s. But Trump, the one who says, “he doesn’t know what he’s talking” because Biden stuttered was borrowed and reported by the media. 24 minutes in, Trump seems to be growing angrier, the scowl begins to appear, and it gets personal, which is what Trump excels at. But Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was a complete disaster.<br><br>Wow. Here it goes — the Israeli Palestinian war. Biden lost my vote 7 months ago. He is complicit in genocide and continues to spout inflammatory rhetoric that condones Israel’s behavior toward a helpless population. It’s there for all to see. But he didn’t lose my vote only. Can’t wait to see election results. Neither man is fit to serve the interests of this country."
1702,we wanted brent peterson!!😭😭
1703,"Trump, Trump, Trump. Everything Biden says Trump did has happened during the Biden adminastration"
1704,Biden is to old and Trump is crazy
1705,It is so embarrassing that biden is our president he can&#39;t even get a sentence out he should be In a nursing home he is wrecking our country
1706,Unreal Biden can&#39;t finish a statement he is senile 😅 go trump 🎉
1707,When Biden says we have trillion billionnairs you know it&#39;s over
1708,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1935"">32:15</a> what do YOU think is happening there w JB&#39;s face? <br><br>Mask scrunching or clone malfunctioning?"
1709,"This is why all American media needs to be investigated and find out who youre actually working for…… you ALL told us Joe Biden was healthy and fit for office. You lied at the highest level and misinformed our country so badly, you put our entire country in horrific danger. Do you know how close we are to WW3 and youre telling us Joe Biden is in charge. Youre LIARS and need to be investigated."
1710,"It’s Sad that we allow Joe Biden crumble right in front of us, he is too old to even be standing there for an hour and  a half"
1711,A person who has dementia should not be running our country ????
1712,Trump has it all over him
1713,Trump:<br>Zelinski is the greatest salesman in History 😂
1714,"Here is how spam order misleading. Parson my mini keyboard typos.<br><br>Nobody in my family have been let make a visit deposit for NBC, ever.<br> I&#39;ve seen no NBC community access studio run by the local library or Mission. Tbats advancing a discredit to whoever doesn&#39;t get the right notice to make givernment contact points in this area. <br><br>I see no signs of that form of specific importance here. <br><br>Indtead i see too much comedy of aughing as it hints at the trauma of no change from the INSIDE OUT. <br><br>Government firgets to start at home indoors tgen pkan out into the public. So we have no delicious in home government styled help, care or way out of the poor houses we are caged into by the goings on in TV next door. <br><br>Dont leave Human resources out of Federal reserves. <br><br>University, cell 🤳 phone holders &amp; makers, news media reporters, dmv, CHP and hospital clinics. Don&#39;t keep stepping past HUMAN RESOURCES for your places of work. Thats this Paula C. (Martinez in pink, punk style Rayon) house. It isn&#39;t a free hours job and if on a GOV check it isnt worth less than minimum wage or an adjusted value with a ticket to work placement."
1715,"Go look at the same debate between these two 4 years ago. Biden today is not the same man he was back then, and in 4 new years he will be even worse. If he becomes president for another four years it puts the world in an extremely uncertain and dangerous place."
1716,Biden is a dottering old man who lost the plot years ago
1717,God bless America are these the only 2 choices we have lord help us
1718,"If Biden cheated the election again, we are going to a world war 3."
1719,Talking about golf? Trump should have challenged him to ride a bike or climb stairs.There were your clues democrats.
1720,&quot;Putin&#39;s a war criminal.&quot;? And Netanyahoo is what? A saint?
1721,😂😂Gahahaha world in Choas and these two arguing about Biden handicap in golf. 😂😂
1722,Trump would’ve won 2020 if he had let joe speak like this…
1723,Biden has an ear piece.  He hasn&#39;t stopped messing with his right ear.
1724,So we can all agree that Trump is the best choice right? 😁
1725,Joe Biden is a liar and full of Obama&#39;s hand
1726,Dumb and dumber
1727,"Biden can barely form a sentence, Jesus we are doomed if he wins again. Get that child sniffer out of office"
1728,Trump is are only hope time to make America great again
1729,Trump didn&#39;t answer many of the questions and talked nonsense. Biden did not seem prepared in any way for a TV debate and he is obviously not up for a second term. Trump is incompetent. Biden is too old. The next years will be a very bumpy ride.
1730,They should be doing way more for are veterans they should come back and have a pice of land with a home on it and pay nothing in taxes they shold live as close to free as possible
1731,We are used to politicians just talking!!
1732,I could care less about both of them but yall rushed to get trump out of office and everything went downhill from there
1733,Where is the American Flag &gt;? What are you people thinking ? Ashamed for you!
1734,amen
1735,❤T❤R❤U❤M❤P❤
1736,Debate? 😂
1737,To go after either of these candidates because of their age is wrong for our country. Their mental health that is another thing! Just like anyone who goes for a job their health should be a major check.
1738,"Notice their eyes.  Biden looks away from Trump every time.  Trump ... during Bidens speaking and when he speaks looks like Trump is punching Bidens eyes out in a boxing match.  Biden mumbles due to his inability to be confronted in every speech he does, whether confronted by Trump or a republican.  Biden walks away when Republicans speak to him outside of this debate.  It is obvious what his problem is.  Walk away from the golf course Biden."
1739,"It wasn&#39;t a presidential debate. It was a debacle more so for Biden, Trump."
1740,Does this guy Biden really think we are really this stupid?
1741,change biden for bernie sanders would be a perfect match against trump
1742,Biden good
1743,"The only reason I can see that they have him running again is they have their compiled mailing list so the fix is in. After he gets selected again, they&#39;ll rid themselves of him. Another 2020..."
1744,My taxes have definitely increased not gone down. Def not making over 175k combined household much less alone
1745,Why does Biden want be President ?
1746,Why does Biden want be President ?
1747,When my mom got Alzheimer’s- she had the same facial expression as Biden. I know that look. Truly sad.
1748,Biden is in la la land 😅
1749,"One clearly knows what he is doing while the other has no idea , sad really...Biden should step down. With all the good people in America, just why? Why are these our only 2 choices??? God please help our Country 🙏"
1750,Biden look bad he need to live his last days at home in  peace
1751,Your to old biden toooooo old
1752,"Bidens &quot;cold&quot; effected his brain. The next day, he suddenly recovered in during his first rally in NC after a shot in his rear, his voice and energy came back, and he was able to read his speak writer&#39;s words on a teleprompter. Funny, how fast his brain recovered."
1753,This two old men are very funny... They are about to get into a boxing ring.
1754,"Two things struck me immediately about the debate presentation. 1) CNN said there would be real time fact checking and there was not... almost total lies from one side. 2) The mic levels were not set properly... Biden&#39;s mic was clearly too low. If one does not think so, watch the North Carolina rally on the following day."
1755,That my daughter tapanga souders Rensselaer in souders llc
1756,"Listen close, I think I hear Trump letting out the wettest shart at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=4310"">1:11:50</a> - right after he says &quot;he can&#39;t because it&#39;s too much money&quot;"
1757,"Those moderators should be the ones debating as to who runs the country while those ol&#39; fogies sit in their wheelchairs and moderate.  Man, I hate modern politics."
1758,"Sleepy joe, confused"
1759,Biden&#39;s fault that Trump&#39;s wealthy corporate friends keep raising prices?????
1760,The only thing Biden did is use our tax payer money to support Ukraine. Thats the only thing he focused on during his entire term. My moms social security increased under Trump.  We will nevet forget the 13 soldiers who died because of Biden he is responsible for their deaths.
1761,CNN lied right from the very beginning $100 in groceries is now more like $150 to $200
1762,biden needs to be in a nursing home
1763,"It is so sad and hard to listen. I am not an American, but i know one thing...USA never looked worser than now. Just take Biden somewhere so he can enjoy his retirement and let Trump clean and run things smoothly."
1764,I can&#39;t believe Biden lied! In America&#39;s face! Shameful!
1765,This debate was less aggressive than four years ago.
1766,"Trump didn’t answer the question about affordable child care. And Biden doesn’t look good. America looks bad by other countries. But, ironically, there’s still opportunities in America, but not for Americans."
1767,Mr. President Joe we love you ❤
1768,Bravo Trump 👏.
1769,His anger is showing! He knows Trump is knocking him out of the water.
1770,I wonder what Obama (he didn’t do anything good but could speak) thinks of this
1771,Jr has earned my vote
1772,"He&#39;s wobbling. His physical strength is gone. This ain&#39;t funny, folks. Not funny at all! Shame on this administration!"
1773,Why is Biden mumbling
1774,"My area is being taken over by ilegal<br> immigrants. They drive brand new trucks and set up with businesses and everything needed for their business, they get way more money in food stamps, they get specialized education have the nicest clothes shoes and hair cuts. They have formed gangs and target kids. The men have wads of money at all times. They sit in their trucks after work drinking beer for hours. They live ten times better than the average household. My state is a blue state and sanctuary state. Under The Trump Administration our vets were vere well taken care of. Since Biden took office vets have not been taken care. Biden is a pathetic liar he has done nothing but sell us off and made an ebarrasement out of the US. The illegals laugh at us."
1775,I&#39;m not meaning to be cruel but Biden looks funny I mean he looks like an alien or he just don&#39;t look real he looks evil I mean it&#39;s sad it is sad look at him in his eyes there&#39;s something bad wrong and it&#39;s bad bad he does not need to be in charge of the nuclear code
1776,"Biden isn&#39;t a King, reigns until his end. International disgrace to do this to a man of his age. World leaders are laughing."
1777,Worthless “moderators.”
1778,They are abusing Biden.  His wife and staff should be prosecuted for elder abuse.  They are just milking him for money.
1779,"Trump solving math problem:<br><br>2x = 6<br><br>So first about the x, I had an ex once, it was horrible, she did horrible things to this equation, worst variable in history, and double that, it&#39;s totally ridiculous. And the way it makes 6 it&#39;s like there&#39;s way too many 6s in this equation, they come from x&#39;s and they come from number lines. And the x is 3 but we need to fix this and BYden made x completely wrong, made up, I never said x was 2. He&#39;s lied billions and billions of times it&#39;s unbelievable."
1780,"Suggesting a new drinking game,  take a shot everytime Biden says &quot;...the idea...&quot;  💀"
1781,"Consider this: instead of just focusing on how Biden seems &#39;worse&#39; and old (which he is, both of them are too old), Biden clearly is ill. If you think Trump talks more slickly and fast, try to listen to what he says. It&#39;s much easier to lie off the top of your head than it is to think more clearly and also be challenging the lies (as Biden did). I was fact-checking this debate, and Trump just lied and lied. The abortion issue regarding Roe v. Wade—Trump lied; Biden fact-checked him.<br><br>One is too old (Biden).<br><br>The other, even if he wasn&#39;t old also, is a pathological liar. He doesn&#39;t care to govern and hold himself accountable, which means you have no idea if he is going to do what he says or if he is even tracking if what he is doing is consistent/in line with his stated aims."
1782,Why does this feel like a sporting event?
1783,"It’s definitely Alzheimer’s. I’ve seen that look before. Let that man go home and die in peace, and stay w his family, while he still-knows who they are."
1784,They can&#39;t be showing Biden when Trump is talking. Dude really looks like he&#39;s hardly there. Wanted to give Biden the benefit of the doubt but this is bad.
1785,Dude on the right was glitchin out.
1786,"I am a veteran, and my father is retired military and we support Biden."
1787,Why can’t we build here in America “OLD JOE”
1788,"To be honest, I&#39;m personally not delighted with Trump either, but Biden looks like an ancient mummy."
1789,botswana supports Trump
1790,What the hel. Biden is a mumbling bumbling doorknob
1791,The USA has over 333 million inhabitants but only has two 80-year-olds running for president..
1792,Does it mean these are the a great country like the US can bring to the table.... So sad
1793,how can a millionaire not afford a better toupe?  Trump still just sounds like a sleezy game show host to me
1794,Donald Trump better seek retribution.
1795,If Biden wins we gonna be third world&#39;s countries.
1796,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAVeia6FVbw"">https://youtu.be/rAVeia6FVbw?feature=shared</a>"
1797,All I hear is one saying why they&#39;re better than the other and calling each other liars... What makes them better than any other candidate though?<br><br>Also why are they arguing about golf?
1798,"Idk if it’s just me but, nothings made me laugh more this week than these two geezers🤣🤣🤣"
1799,The most ridiculous debate ever. The format was a joke. The fact that they had to rush to answer questions was so uncomfortable to watch. Biden was like he couldn&#39;t breathe because of that he had to speak so fast . CNN must be ashamed of themselves for such a terrible stupid format. And trump continues to lie the whole time. What is the point of debate if they can&#39;t not talk to each other.  Plus all the questions were pointless. What was with the drum rolls . What is this? A circus? Are they trying to have a show business or a presidential debate?. Come on man!  Jake tapper and Dana bash looked like fools to go along with this so called show.
1800,"This is what happens when you have different parties, country is against each other like always. That&#39;s why I follow no party."
1801,"For debate, I think I prefer the no studio audience approach (no cheers, no boos)."
1802,joey should jail Jill for not protecting the elderly
1803,"Every one of biden&#39;s claims stands on thin ice of semantics... inflation? Ignores government spending... border? Says he hired asylum officers (like that stops it instead of encouraging it) Etc etc etc, you have to live under a rock to take him seriously... and he lies constantly while accusing trump of lying, the hold the media has on dems is scary"
1804,No military deaths under his administration? That&#39;s a Biden lie.
1805,CNN blocked comments 😂😂😂
1806,even the way that biden walked out was sad
1807,Very sad that we are at the year 2024 and still taking about colores when mentioing people .<br>By the way are there any studies saying if illegal immigrants include people with mental issues and killers  and at what percentage !!!!!.
1808,"biden scratched his nose at one stage when answering a question ...  I researched this behaviour ...   &quot;&quot;  The fear of getting caught in a lie triggers the fight-or-flight response, which, among other physiological responses, causes vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure. Increased blood pressure causes the tissues inside the nose to swell and tingle, thus making it itchy.11 June 2023&quot;&quot;&quot;"
1809,"Joe&#39;s problem is not his age, it is his ideas against the US, that is what is worrying, he wants to destroy the US, he already controls the media, justice, etc. He controls like China, his partner, and Ukraine. its other partner Burisma"
1810,I’m sorry
1811,Joe is to old for this
1812,I really wish the aliens weren’t cake.
1813,Why aren’t they talking over each other like the last debate
1814,"It is amazing to me that anyone believes, let alone understands, anything that comes out of Joe Biden&#39;s mouth."
1815,"Americans: both support Israel unconditionally- this is not your country. Number 1.<br>2. Unlike what the media conglomerates would have you believe, there are more than 2 predidencial candidates you can vote for.<br>Both liars. This is not democracy."
1816,Trump 2024🎉
1817,"Is Biden a fake, a robot? His movements are like brushless motors especially when he turns the head and he bats his eyelashes. Arms movements are coordinated at the same time and a lot of times at the same distance…. Has anyone noticed? look at the differences with the trump person"
1818,Biden takes 1 min or 2 min to blink. Watch his eyes.
1819,The look on Joe Biden&#39;s face says. I JUST CRAPPED MY PANTS. AGAIN.
1820,Kennedy won and he has brain worms!
1821,"Where it’s at, two turd sandwiches with microphones. Can we flush them both and start fresh?"
1822,There should be age restrictions no matter who&#39;s in power
1823,Why did Biden give $200 billion to Ukraine? For what that’s not even our country! Never spoke anything about Maui disaster!
1824,ßiden has the morals of a cornered rat
1825,I can&#39;t believe how foolish Biden looked. His face was just annoying to look at and he was just such a total utter liar and he got called out for it
1826,"if FAMILY&#39;s stay together, there is no need for CHILD care help"
1827,"Shame on America for voting for this kook, the &quot;Big Guy&quot;"
1828,How much they paid you Donald you are a lucer
1829,Biden looks very weak with no energy !
1830,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=61"">1:01</a> ...thank you. No blink blink."
1831,Ha ha ha

1833,This government has forgotten about God.
1834,Love Trump 🌍
1835,Love Trump 🌍
1836,Why didn&#39;t the Democrats nominate VP Harris?
1837,My president is in control of every thing
1838,"Biden needs to retire after he loses this election, not before. The primaries have already been held."
1839,Specifically people like you that oh please stop talking so much garbage
1840,I’ve never been more embarrassed in my life…they’ve made a game show out of our pre-elections..what’s next? (Perhaps people voting from home on their cell phones?)
1841,Who else went straight to the comments?
1842,A petition for Elder Care abuse on the &quot;Big Guy&quot;.
1843,Yes millionaire should pay more taxes
1844,How did Biden get elected in the first place? Jeez
1845,When Biden open his mouth all the lies come out
1846,You’re gonna tell me that these dumb fools are the best candidates to run our country? BS!
1847,This debate is exposing difficult choices. Let&#39;s go for a candidate has a better record for healthcare and reproductive care. Let’s see more from other debates after the conventions.  🇺🇸
1848,I can’t even understand Biden . He needs to go
1849,Wow good job  CNN for an outstanding job on this debate. You just earned a new subscriber.
1850,Trump sorry but we have the best FBI in the world and they discovered that the Russian control you brain like you wife did that&#39;s the way they work
1851,World is laughing at America - a cuckoo vs a con is America&#39;s choice.
1852,Dude what is that choice?
1853,This whole &quot;red tie vs. Blue tie&quot; thing is played out.
1854,Want to see what ALZHEIMERS looks like?  Watch Joe.  I am a retired Nursing Home Director with training and certification in Dementia patients.
1855,You have no heart Trump........
1856,Biden needs wat so he can steaoney to his pocket. Its bidens war not UK. Thats why he keeps givingoney to UK killing. Alot of people biden you have touch blood in your hands wait till humter goes to prison and doesnot come back like you other son boa.
1857,"In Europe we have never heard such nonsense that Biden and the democrats that ruined your country. When Trump was president we all had so much respect for Trump. He speaks from his heart. President Trump did not take 1 dollar in salary when he was president, its true he loves his country and want t o make your county great again. That will be hard after all democrats has destroyed"
1858,Mostly woman are hurt by bidens evacuation
1859,"The lies, the lies, the likes Trump tell have me cracking up!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1860,Did you get the memory of the present bident the best of the world
1861,Biden what progress are talking about you got the greatest economy when you came in  you did nothing Trump did it all wr see all we do our research.
1862,"Please get out of office, Biden. Our country is begging you at this point."
1863,IT IS SAD THAT BIDEN IS FUNDING UK WAR.  BIDEN SHOW UP TO COMGRESS HEARING TAKE YOUR SON EITH YOU. BIDEN YOU ARE SO SICK AND SUCH A LIAR AMERICA LOVES TRUMP HATES BIDEN AND FAMILY.
1864,"Our military numbers are dwindling, and I feel like the lack of confidence in our current POTUS and his questionable loyalty and foreign policy is a large factor. When trump was in office, troops recieved the largest pay raise they had gotten in 20 years. They were also INSPIRED to serve under trump. Troops defended their country with pride and strength. They were revered worldwide and numbers across all branches were at a premium. It quickly became just a day job for many of them these last couple years."
1865,I just love the way everytime they ask Trump a question he talks about himself. Shaking my head!!!!!!!
1866,"How embarrassing for the US. This debate was rough to listen to. Why not let RFK debate? Whatever your beliefs, why not just let him debate with Biden and Trump? Imagine you&#39;re Russia, China, Israel or Iran, who would you want to win? America has Trump, Or Biden... how sad. Really, thats who america chooses."
1867,"Why can they not just cut the mic every time tRump goes on a unrelated tangent? Did he even answer a single question? I&#39;m no fan of Biden, and this didn&#39;t make him look good but ffs, at least he was trying to actually answer the questions. I&#39;m not even going into the complete deflection that was the Jan 6th insurrection question. Jfc. Keep bragging about your golf score tRump AND WHY ARE THEY EVEN DEBATING THEIR GOLF SCORES?!?"
1868,Think of it this way we as people have already won. We needed this debate so everyone can visually see and hear the incompetence Biden spews. When Trumps wins we can then get back on track. If somehow Biden wins (js considering “votes” got him presidency)then we the people will permanently remove him from his seat because ALL OF US is efffing done with Biden 🤷‍♂️ FAFO
1869,America never was so strong like know whit president Biden we don&#39;t want ignorant like trump
1870,Biden wont dare take exams because his IQ is very low if any there
1871,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

1882,Yes thats how bad it is biden you have destroyed us  and know it. Trump is the president we ever had you see every state he goes through wr the people wait for him. Trump we wait for you. Biden you are the worse president ever.
1883,"It’s funny how Biden said Trump was separating illegal babies from their parents. Obama was doing that at Lackland AFB, TX years before that. They had kids in the old boot camp barracks on the airforce base and it looked like a prison for kids. It was sad when they would bring bus loads of them on the base."
1884,Oh wat a  bold Trump don&#39;t disturb again please ga out
1885,Biden you freeze you look like a zombie when you just stare.looks like you are ready to pass out.
1886,Omg golf 😅 challenge

1898,Give trump the border work not presidency
1899,Look back on your old door dash order prices and reorder it… see how much it actually went up! 113 went to 300 on mine

1902,Biden you are done😂
1903,Like a DEBATE will make me forget that Trump is an insane and narcissistic whoremonger and malevolent dictator.
1904,Biden climate changes you have   not.
1905,Am i the only one who noticed bidens replies are scripted he always says well 1.... Etc 2...... Etc and 3...... Etc muktiple times like its scripted for him or rehearsed

1908,"Mr. Biden, Russia is a world power, you don&#39;t call their bluff sir. You mediate and  not support their opponents with weapons. Terrible foreign policy. For his ego, Putin will drag this war till eternity come. Leadership change is needed in America."
1909,All Donal Chump knows is:<br>  How to lie.
1910,What&#39;s up with Joe Biden&#39;s...CHIN 😮

1928,Trump is the best agent ever have America trump you multillonary protect is not possible sorry and our president Mister Biden is not give to not body secret of the system we use in. Icontry
1929,This is an embarrassment farce performance from Biden worthy of a Shakespeare play - &quot;Dim As Thou Art&quot; if I may suggest a title. He is a chronically ill barely functional invalid who should have stepped down the day after his inauguration that was stolen from Trump by the corrupt. But the only drawback would have been some one even worse who would have occupied the white house to propagate the hostile leftist intentions for our country. The democrat leftist progressive agenda to destroy America continues and hopefully people will wise up by November.
1930,"tRumpstain will NEVER make America, his own little Russia AGAIN! Wake tf up tRumpers! He&#39;s divided this nation and is trying to continue his anarchy."
1931,"Biden didn’t follow the rules, of course. We saw his papers and his pen plenty. Trump 2024!"

1937,Biden looks like our chancellor over here in Germany.. like a deer in headlights. Sad to see what has happened to our countries!!!
1938,"Number 1, Number 2 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Biden"
1939,You know what’s worst is knowing corporations own us and the lives they spare in nuclear war
1940,Love that Trump is respecting the speaking time now. Went from comedian to most serious person in government.
1941,Trump you are done you don&#39;t know what you are talking about
1942,"MR. TRUMP  did  not stick  to one  of his  question, buddy you can do better, try a  little harder to do better."
1943,Biden you liar OMG you are miserable you took a hole week to study this lies. We are not blind or death we saw everything.
1944,Trump Trump trump
1945,"They are not laughing at us, they are laughing at you two."
1946,Trump 2024<br> Its true. This immigrants are not good people.
1947,Yeah he works hard spends days in beach. Going home  staying home napping. Such a jerk. Trump is right on everything. He should deport all.
1948,"Like many in my generation, I don&#39;t watch TV. Heard the Old Orange Fascist bullied everyone. Vote Blue! - a Gen Z Republican"
1949,OMG i can not believe he took a hole week to prepare this lies.
1950,I don’t know Joe you are a career criminal
1951,The number of Fentanyl  cases os higher than any
1952,Oh some shut old fart from lying. He is a big time liar how can he stand there and do that. We the people see all . It dont if he lies we see it live it.
1953,Trump couldn&#39;t answer the last question about if he would accept the results of the election. Biden answered it well...... Trump is a whiny whiny.
1954,Easy decision making on deciding who to vote for.<br>Did you live better under trump or biden? That should be the deciding factor right now. Not if u like someone or not.
1955,He needs some milk and a nap. 🥛😴
1956,I miss Obama :’(
1957,Is taxes fare thats what biden asked
1958,Tonald dump ruins everything he touches
1959,Trump on his A game.
1960,Look people we live in a fuel driven economy. Gas prices were almost half with Trump . How con you forget that? Economies was great under Trump . Always wanted to see a business man run the country instead of a career politician
1961,"So hard to watch these 2 debate to run our country and we the people, Right or Left , can&#39;t come up with other options? These 2 need to be more like counsel than our leaders. People this can&#39;t be it.  This is all our own fault."
1962,Tell Tonald dump to stop LIAING!!!
1963,Can we just talk about how I’m pretty sure this is the first presidential debate that they took breaks in… or is it just me?
1964,"The idea, the idea, the idea, Jesus Christ, this man says “the idea” more in 1 hour than anyone has ever said it in a single lifetime."
1965,Totally rolled past the childcare cost question with this dumb bickering
1966,Biden left billions of dollars of weapons in Afghanistan
1967,&quot;I really dont know what he said at the end of that sentence  and i dont think he knows either&quot; 🤣😆trump is such a bad a**❤<br>UM BIDEN U LITTERLY INVITED IMMIGRANTS IN THEY THANKED U.
1968,Why do they keep giving Biden a min to respond when he wants too but they tell trump it will be after his question so he can’t answer what they ask?
1969,America needs a third good choice!
1970,As far as these two candidates we are damned if we do and damned if we don’t vote for either one. We need fresh and new faces in the chair with better leadership capabilities and perspectives for our country.
1971,"Rise Humanity rise. Rise above all the lies. Rise above old idealology Humanity is one big family, what injures you injures me. It is time to break free and begin; to heal Humanity from within and greet each other Soul to Soul.<br>Namaste"
1972,Biden needs to go home and take a nap tbh…
1973,BIDEN IS 💩
1974,"In politics nothing happens by accident, if it happens it was planned that way.                                   Franklin D Roosevelt"
1975,"The way he had arbitrary information; he has a very skillful way of talking. He has this talent for saying thing in a way that is convincing not by display is fax, but by way of emotional manipulation and gaslighting.. one important fact, is that women control the market in terms of spending power, I’ve heard lots of people say this I remember reading it once but more women buy things, why did I say that? Marketing convincing to the home you have to get the wife, the woman sister, the mother.. if her motions are driving, her purchases her desires in the market things that-she sees I need to be able to control her emotionally and mentally. If I can control her, then it will be easy to get to support of her brother of her uncle of her father.<br>So one thing I want to apologize for first before I continue is that I’ve always missed categorize Trump supporters as being stupid , today, I just learned that not only are they not stupid, they are simply helpless and they desire peace. So it turns out we want the same things. We’re just going about it differently to get there.. Why did I say that Trump doesn’t say things to support his messages in a way you look for Support and say a gossip thread air quote receipts usually come with time and actual numerical value, America has given him the past that he needs none of that, Trump needs to sound good. He needs to say things in way that is not only convincing but emotionally compelling."
1976,Did he say there was no inflammation under his watch? 😂😂😂
1977,I don’t understand why we are ending up with only these two as choices… is this a joke? Where are the real candidates at?  And the news just feeds into this like it’s appropriate.  It feels like the twilight zone. We need  a real human that loves people and can lead us into future with togetherness and spirit. I’m tired of seeing leaders who share the same office arguing and blaming instead of putting there heads together and figuring this out
1978,Make America Great again papa 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
1979,Will anybody vote for crazy biden again
1980,Biden cant fire anyone hes a ineffective negotiator and manager.   Biden never held a private job.
1981,Trump elected and US becomes United States of Lies

1983,"This is so embarrassing. We&#39;ve got Trump spending his whole time spouting lies and trash talk without even answering the questions, while Biden is up there barely alive or even able to speak coherently."
1984,Biden giving alot more to immigrants then us citizens.

1997,Ciao Biden...
1998,I really don’t see Biden seeing the end of a second term if he wins honestly
1999,What is he saying 😂😂😂😂
2000,"If Bidens closing statement didn’t seal this election away, idk what did. He went over 8 points in 2 sentences and didn’t finish any of them🤣🤣🤣"
2001,Seems like Biden is always getting the last comment.  CNN can&#39;t save Biden.
2002,Trump ❤
2003,Please help us 🙏
2004,Trump ❤
2005,Biden is GONE OFF THE BOOF.<br>Look at that face<br>TRUMP 2024
2006,"Biden is too old and affected by his age to be running this country, that&#39;s #1, #2, 😂🤣I couldn&#39;t resist... All BS aside, I liken Biden to nothing more than a domestic terrorist, he has completely destroyed our country, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars found in the White House, not once, but TWICE during his term! And we haven&#39;t even begun to see the damage that he has done to our country by ordering the borders to be opened! The things that have already happened (tragic, sickening things) are goona be minor compared to what we&#39;re going to see unfold over the next decade or 2... We&#39;ll be throwing so much $ at this problem dealing with these illegal criminal immigrants that will make our national debt seem low!  I&#39;m all for immigrants coming here and making a life for themselves but believe it should be done in an orderly fashion and a due process. They didn&#39;t get into the PROOF of Biden election fraud in 2020,or how the Biden Administration is behind all the charges against Trump. Trump may not be the best option for our country either, but he&#39;s definitely the best option we have in my opinion."
2007,"Again, DJT isn&#39;t the problem,  the people who support him are to blame. DJT will always be what he is.  Shameful,  really 😢😮."
2008,"In this debate nobody has won. Trump is a looser without political knowledge, moral but thinks he is the new Messias while Biden is to old to Form plausible sentences."
2009,Trump 2024
2010,"The problem I have with Trump is the way he present positions his information, and I think people who like Trump do this also- when they agree or disagree with something, they generalize their feelings on it to include a large number of people that support them, and they make it so ambiguous it becomes easy to believe, I’m not sure if this is something written down in the book, but the behavior is trackable."
2011,God bless 🙌 Trump. As a American that works 7 days a week to raise a family like he is still working even when he dosent need to
2012,The world doesn&#39;t want wars. The world needs Trump.
2013,"I can&#39;t be the only one who hears that &quot;splat&quot; after Trump says: &quot;because it&#39;s too much money&quot; <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=4310"">1:11:50</a>"
2014,Donald Trump is the ONLY choice. Biden is nothing more than a face and figure for the dnc to control. Everything is worse with him. Biden is the worst president in american history
2015,President Trump should ask Biden if he even cares about Americans

2032,"I don&#39;t understand much about politics.  I do understand money and a budget.  I&#39;m a stay at home mom of 5. We are middle-class (my husband is a teacher). Under Trump we received on average a tax refund of $2,500. Under Biden we owed $4,000  even though we had a new baby. Cost of everything is depressing.  Our oldest goes off to college this year. We applied for federal money for college...denied and told we should be able to afford 60 k per year. That would put us in poverty."
2033,"The moderators tried to save Biden a few times but the damage was already done, Trump is going to be the next president, Dems are in denial."
2034,"As a Foundational American man the homies and I are voting for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#Trump2024</a>"

2049,Your voice doesn’t matter. The system is rigged. They don’t put America first it’s a big play and your paying for tickets if you want to or not. Put yourself first.
2050,"Wish you all the best Mr:Trump, United states needs a strong president like you."
2051,Liar Biden you care more about the countries and not Americans
2052,Picking between this two nominees is like deciding which std you would rather catch.
2053,Trump is actually a better candidate for the Americans and for the world
2054,My husband has paid on a student loan for over 20 years . There’s no forgiveness.
2055,"I love when the options are a genocidal maniac or a fascist genocidal maniac, why exactly are we letting two old men who were born in the 40-50&#39;s decide our future, we shouldn&#39;t let people who were born before the phone be in office"

2060,Biden showered with His Daughter He’s a Sick Baster
2061,😅
2062,Holy sweet baby Jesus Biden has one foot in the grave and the other is hanging on to loose gravel. I truly believe he’s had to have been medicated on uppers to stand that long he sounded like he was really ready to fall asleep.
2063,"I think Trump&#39;s stance on NATO is concerning in a bit short-sighted. I don&#39;t know if he realizes that a million humans invading at $1 a piece will easily overpower a thousand humans defending at $1,000 a piece. There&#39;s a conversion factories missing because money for him is the bottom line and I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s seeing past it, or seeing historically either."
2064,I think Biden is a clone thats malfunctioning.
2065,Who release the virus to destroy the world and start the war ?
2066,"All that Biden says is platitude after platitude. Everything he says about black families is patronizing and aloof. All he believes in are handouts and discounts based on skin color. What about fixing problems? Addressing root causes? Why are people struggling financially, Joe? Why?"
2067,Trump nods his head in approval of some good points biden makes. 5.36
2068,End asylum

2076,Hollow Head Joe
2077,If what Joe Biden talking about taxes break on the wealthy. Don&#39;t all the senates and house members should also get hit with the taxes too?
2078,"Trump nailed this.  I voted for Biden and his administration but know I regret my vote.  I do not agree with what happened at the capitol but I do not blame Trump for that happening.  I do not agree with what happened at the Capital but I also do not agree with with what is happening around our states.  Especially, Portland , Seattle and Chicago just among a few.  People going out of control and destroying and rioting .  I have friends that worked hard to start small businesses in Portland and Seattle.  They worked hard for their dream and then I watch on TV to see people smashing their windows and destroying their businesses.  This is disgraceful."
2079,"Biden has lost it. Imagine trying to have a casual conversation with the guy, let alone something nuanced and complex. Why would you want the guy to be a part of any decision-making process?"
2080,Ask about climate ill tlk about black ppl

It&#39;s like he&#39;s trying to Convince us of everything hes blown away by 😮it&#39;s all he thinks about😢"

2103,Let’s go trump

2105,"All a joke. We the people that work every day to survive ,pay the government until we die. They are rich from our hard work. They are our employees but our employees rule us, this is totally backwards. It&#39;s our money that is being given to every other country other then back to us. We outnumber them and need to take them off the pedestal make them the employees they are and take our title of the boss back."
2106,TRUMP!!! Why are we even arguing?!!
2107,I am a veteran.  Biden is a piece of @##$.

2112,Biden is all lies.
2113,Listen we have believe in president biden we know him only one Will continue better things for us.
2114,"go maga,joe bidens fired"
2115,Since the end of 2020 US Presidential election. Joe Biden cabinet members have been making decisions for America due to Joe Biden old age and his mental state of mind. If you watch vido back then before he was President Obama Vice President. You will understand what I&#39;m saying
2116,"Oh Mr Popok I&#39;ve been following your and the rest of the Meidas trust cast for months. I am severely disabled and housebound and I can&#39;t believe that for the last 4 days and nights I&#39;ve been dealing with theft, fraud, credit card fraud, fighting with my doctors and have literally had 9 hours sleep in all that time as I&#39;ve been uploading evidence, to the police, my credit card fraud investigation team, my district manager of my paid for care company and a whole host of others and MISSED you losing your (non bet of course) $1 imaginary bet now that the Supreme Court has unbelievablely found Trump has no immunity for the crimes he committed while he was president as well as before and after!!! So many charges so much time 😂😂😂 oh it&#39;s the best tonic for lack of sleep ever. Ty so much to everyone on the Meidas touch for all of your amazing content. Oh and of course the news that Trump is Toast. There is no way even the loony left can wheel him out as the MAGA Republican parties presidential nominee well they might I surmise they are crazy enough 🙏🙏🙏. It would be THE most massive margin of victory since president Washington and probably even higher than his majority. President Kennedy (God rest his soul) must be chuckling very loudly and holding his sides from laughing so much 😂😂😂. In Trumpian rhetoric &quot;there has never been a president greater than me for building up personal crimes and criminal liability to the presidency, I&#39;ve become like a third world failed dictator 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. JUSTICE MATTERS!!!"
2117,"Biden STILL continues to lie,that&#39;s the number one thing people are sick and tired of hearing from him.<br>And my gawd does he look old a frail,other countries are walking all over us now,BECAUSE OF HIM.<br>His hatred for Trump and republicans is written all over his face,the evil stares,the very negative remarks<br>about Making America Great Again."
2118,"Dude I. This is by far the worse I’ve ever seen Biden. Like I always knew he was a senile old flea bag. But dude at some point, this needs to elderly abuse."
2119,At a hr 1: 16 in the video Biden say we&#39;re at the End of the world 🤔 What????? Listen I know I just didn&#39;t hear this man say that😮
2120,Biden. Dadaddaaddaddddddaaaaa
2121,Right on Trump he speaks the whole truth
2122,"I’m a conservative canadian. I really have no dog in this fight. But I don’t think Biden messed up as bad as people are making it out to be. Yeah he mumbles his words sometimes but the substance of what he’s saying is relatively reasonable to the questions at hand. <br><br>I think that America would be better off economically with trump in office but the issue is that he’s a compulsive liar, which inherently dissolves the people’s trust in him (atleast those of which are able to tell he’s lying or misleading). If he addressed questions without making any misleading claims like he did on the all in podcast I think he would poll much better."
2123,Biden has no energy to speak !!!! He has not done anything to stop wars in Gaza and Ukraine!!!!!!!
2124,Come on Joe spit it out what an embarrassment
2125,Trump is a dealer and does great for Americans
2126,I’m so glad to see that many of you finally came to your senses and realize that you shouldn’t have voted for Biden in the first place! I can’t wait for Trump to be president and get America 🇺🇸 back to what it was! <br>Joe 🫤 needs to go to a nursing home and yall know it.
2127,"&quot;We are missing peace. Please come back, President Trump.&quot;"
2128,Trump 🎉 Biden not qualified my friend!!! Biden can not be the chef in command !!!! Enough
2129,"Trump is a truthteller. Many people, especially sociopathic, dont like truthtellers. His transparency is what the country needs, despite hard truths and harder decisions."
2130,I didn’t know that Dumb and Dumber 3 dropped
2131,Trump 🎉 Biden not qualified my friend!!! Biden can not be the chef in command !!!! Enough
2132,Biden supporter here.       Trump makes some sense.
2133,Trump 🎉 Biden not qualified my friend!!!
2134,Trump wasn’t lying when he said Biden will drive us into world war 3 !!!! Biden has destroyed our country and I TOLD YALL NOT TO VOTE FOR HIM AND LOOK NOW YALL PAYING 5$ a gallon of gas and milk is 3 almost 4 dollars!!!
2135,Trump 🎉 🎉🎉🎉🎉

2138,The poor going to pay Biden and middle class Biden trump let&#39;s gooooo
2139,The 1st question about “Hamas” and Israel about had me to turn off this lying circus show
2140,"&quot;This debate is enough to give Trump the right to lead America without competition, but we don&#39;t know what goes on behind the scenes.&quot;"
2141,Yes Joe it has been debunked <br>Just last week one of the biggest little liberal fact checker ✅ has come out and said Trump never said what Biden said Trump said <br>So once again Joe Biden is lying
2142,The control Trump shows. Perfect.
2143,Thats a LIE BIDEN!
2144,I have no idea what Biden is saying and I’m playing this with subtitles so I can read and still can’t make sense of what he’s saying 😅
2145,Honestly please someone pinch me this must be a nightmare 😢
2146,"Biden..my son and I have been putting together jobs the entire time you&#39;ve been in office with the exception of the first 3 months. This is actually what residents of Mexico do. They go out and look for work everyday. We have no job security and hold several different jobs with businesses that can only afford to have us on board one day a week. No benefits at all because you, Biden, have killed businesses and in turn US citizens are suffering and drowning."
2147,"I&#39;m wondering where that &quot;True American Patriot Veteran of the III% (ptsd or not, ) is, that seems to be holding back for whatever reason,  hasn&#39;t STOOD TALL AND ELIMINATED THIS THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY AND IT&#39;S PEOPLE...??"
2148,"It doesn’t matter if you’re a Biden or Trump supporter, Biden sounds inebriated….the difference in their abilities to speak, and even to stand up, are vastly different. Biden sounds drunk or drugged and slurs and looks like he’s about to fall asleep standing up or fall down or pass out. It’s almost cruel that his family and his Political party are pushing him to continue when he has no business being in any position other than in retirement and likely hospice care."
2149,Biden is truly embarrassed bcuz trump is hitting him straight facts.
2150,Flat out lying about not denying Israel anything but 2000 lb bombs.
2151,I think it should be a golfing match of trump vs Biden for who wins presidency
2152,I’m not going lie.. Biden has made this entire country embarrassing.. I agree with trump WE WILL NOT MAKE ANOTHER 4 years with Biden! Idk why people even voted for him.. I know many illegals that get over a thousand in foodstamps meanwhile their husbands they don’t put on their case working construction getting paid 30hr! Biden is bringing a lot of illegals and I really never thought I’d say this but we need them out!!! If you can’t get visa or do it the right way you need to go your taking housing government assistance meanwhile I’m a. Citizen and I’m homeless with a child!!😢
2153,It’s funny that he’s saying veterans are better off now I have a bunch of veterans that hang out at my job. Tell her totally different story. I don’t know if Biden is being fed the wrong information or if he’s just in total denial kind of like a dream land state he’s got it all wrong.
2154,This is CNNs new reality show called The Home😂😂
2155,CNN is ending Biden career by setting such rules
2156,Exaggerating vs Mumbling 🇺🇲 lord save us
2157,To consider someone that turned California into a third world state for anything but a recall would be beyond stupid…
2158,I literally needed to put on subtitles for Biden
2159,America will be doomed if Biden  had a second term!! 😂😂
2160,I wanna know why aren’t Veterans automatically eligible for government assistance like food stamps and housing. We actually fought for this country.
2161,"“For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all.”<br>‭‭Luke‬ ‭8‬:‭17‬ ‭<br><br>Shame on you Biden <br>“The United States Constitution was stablished by the Founding Father’s <br>The founders believed that God endowed humanity with certain “inalienable rights,” ideas that were influenced by social contract and natural rights<br>Devout founders like John Jay believed that the Bible was the inspired, perfect Word of God, and they expressed this belief by leading Bible societies<br>They valued the Bible not only for its rich literary qualities but also for its insights into human nature, civic virtue, social order, political authority <br>They believed that the main factor in serving God was living a good and moral life, that promoting morality was the central value and purpose of religion”<br>You are ruining our country shame on you !<br>Shame on all the people who voted for you !<br>shame on all the ones who will be voting for you again !"
2162,A report
2163,"Lord, pls have mercy on America’s struggling people! These two are not a right fit to run this country!"
2164,This was the most embarrassing moment in American history
2165,2024 Presidential Debate Sponsered by BenGay Extra Strength😂
2166,"Anyone who has to buy groceries or gas and thinks this is the best economy ever is delusional, just like Biden! And my heart breaks for anyone who is having to buy or rent a house!"
2167,In complete denial Biden
2168,I&#39;m not wealthy but my family benefited from Trump tax cuts.   I had on average 1500 more even though i make more money now.. you&#39;re crazy to believe otherwise. They have stolen from every American at every step and lie non stop
2169,If Trump dont win. Im beyond scared for our future😢
2170,"Oh my god, the veteren section of this debate is the biggest load of nothing I&#39;ve ever heard. It was just &quot;Him bad, me good&quot; with literally no evidence given from either side."
2171,Biden went to bed. Trump went to work
2172,"Mr. BS trump, Liar extraordinaire, putting three additional puppets on the Stupreme Corrupted Court, knowing little to nothing at all about anything, is a major disaster movie in the making. President Biden in 2024, minimal mr. trump for 20-24 years behind bars."
2173,Stopppp saying that trump is lying without actually prove him wrong. Nice words though.
2174,What in the actual…. I don’t want either of them to represent our country. SMH!
2175,Oh my God. Biden can barely speak!!! How can people actually vote for a man that can&#39;t even finish a sentence! Absolutely insanity.
2176,The open mouth fish look is dementia
2177,I love how the both of them just completely go around the child care question 🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽
2178,Where are All these Supposed Biden Supporters in the Comments? Just sayin.
2179,Biden how can you sit there and LIE you should be kicked out of this debate you LIAR !
2180,Inflation was lowest under trump along with fuel.. let&#39;s not forget the bidens are on the take for access to Joe and the biden laptop fiasco along with the cocaine and gun issues with Hunter. There is only one choice for the poor and it&#39;s not Joe
2181,Trump calls black people ....&quot;them&quot; . That jumped out to me.
2182,I never owed taxes under Trump! I&#39;ve owed every year under Biden. Anyone else notice that for themselves too?
2183,Afghanistan was absolute outrage. We left all that equipment for terrorists. What a joke.
2184,Trump is not only a financial genius but a great political strategist. God bless him.
2185,Social security is a joke
2186,Biden is burnt toast 🤦‍♀️
2187,Haha what a waste of money..  no matter what Joe says inflating the cost of  goods and money is a regressive tax.  His leadership has cost every American opportunity that trump allowed growth and affordability.  120 dollars for groceries is a lie.. you&#39;re lucky if 100 back then would buy 40 worth today.. not even taking about gas.
2188,Omg Biden is pathetic and frail...
2189,We need younger candidates.  This is like a bad divorce
2190,I watched this and thought I had dropped acid
2191,"If the sea levels keep rising, why do rich people keep buying beach front property?"
2192,If you vote for Biden you are the problem!
2193,He forgot he’s president already 😂 what do you mean “if I’m elected”??
2194,So this guy is the POTUS? What a joke!!!!!
2195,Biden said if elected he would restore Rowe V Wade but he is already President… someone needs to let him know😂
2196,Trump avoiding the child care question soo bad😂
2197,Both old new trump talk about old news Biden just old I’m not voting 😊for

I can&#39;t imagine watching this and saying, &quot;Well, I can&#39;t vote for that guy. Listen to his voice.&quot; It&#39;s just as bizarre as counting out RFK, Jr. due to his voice. Americans have a serious choice between starkly different approaches to government, personal freedoms, and everything in between. One candidate spent the entire debate telling lie after lie, but we&#39;re supposed to ignore this?"

Additionally, not  once did my chow hall put up any thing for men’s mental health awareness, so many no no words I want to use to describe how disgraceful you are Biden to this country."

2233,"If Trump loses, then that will only solidify the fact that our voting system is faulted because I’m not saying that anybody’s perfect I would like myself if I could, but come on"
2234,My 3 veteran ( son&#39;s) are having a terrible time with their vetran benefits.  Joe should be ashamed of his own results. <br>Bye bye Joe.<br>Our country needs to repair Joe&#39;s damage  he has done.

2260,Biden makes up some builshit
2261,How did either of these men ever become president
2262,Oh 1%! 10 grand per million!!?? Oh wooooooo is me!?

2264,Seemed like a skit from SNL.  This is what we&#39;re offered by the parties??  Both suck....I feel like I&#39;m in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.
2265,Usa clown country
2266,"Joe Biden is a gentleman and I don&#39;t care. You could say what you want about him. But that&#39;s my guy, and I can say. I love him and trust him with my life."
2267,"First of all, you shouldn’t be making deals with pharmaceutical companies, ibuprofens, and Tylenol or whatever is one thing allergies you know that kind of stuff but is he really going there? Maybe we should stop being such a fat America and we wouldn’t need insulin."

2285,Both are worse Presidents ....sorry ....No vote for either......American malayalis from Florida USA 🇺🇸
2286,Trumpppppppp
2287,I lived in Paris France when Trump was elected the first time. They see him as a childish immature individual who can&#39;t stop running his mouth. While its true that Trump is a good businessman which is in his favor his loud mouth is very bad for foreign policy. I fear the economics we&#39;ll face if Biden wins however I fear nuclear war if Trump gets elected. Orally teasing violent dictators is bad as they don&#39;t understand poker faces and political posturing.  Dictators are trigger happy reactive idiots. <br>On the other hand if we starve to death and unemployment goes up there won&#39;t be much of a country left.<br>I&#39;d rather walk blindfolded off a cliff and hope to survive than vote for either of these men!
2288,Who else went straight to the comments?
2289,"OK, I have decided I am going to run for Congress and eventually work my way up to the White House to at least be vice president under Tucker Carlson or Herman Cain!!!"

2296,"Biden’s nothing but a lying piece of crap, he is destined for the lake of fire"
2297,They look like brothers mouth fighting in the house
2298,"how to get the cleanest water, well montana, colorado know. Filter the water before it gets to the rivers. More USDA programs that benefits clean water and also wildlife and also public hunting/conservation."
2299,"Although geratric Joe can talk policy and actual actions. He is not fit to be doing anything other than living out the last few years in prison for war crimes against Palestine. <br>My fear with Trump is that, almost all his answers so far have been in regards to immigration. This is a very Hitler style tactic, that only promotes to sow discourse between the populous. I genuinely fear for the furture of our planet. &quot;Front row seats, to the ends of the earth&quot;"
2300,"OK, I have decided I am going to run for Congress and eventually work my way up to the White House to at least be vice president under Tucker Carlson"
2301,Donald Trump turned every ally away from us. We would&#39;ve gotta attack by Russia. We had nobody to protect us because he blew every connection. For the United States he was trying to destroy us. You don&#39;t do That.
2302,We’re in a banana republic currently where the elite get a pass on illegal crimes and anyone who wants justice for the country get hamstringed in the legal system. I don’t care what party you support this corruption should worry all of us.

2317,Trump has to change America
2318,trump will keep getting stuff done. business men never stop working. No lame duck with trump.

2320,"Joe cant possibly believe the things he says,hes either delusional or people are lying to him"
2321,Trump the only president to be impeached five times over..?
2322,At this point…. Y’all wanna vote for me for president? 😂😂😂
2323,"I’m on a fixed income due to social security disability having a severe disability from working my previous job. I used to make do but over night I’m in the negative on all my bills and have no option to increase my income.  Under Trump I made due, under Biden I’m struggling financially.  I can’t be the only one."
2324,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=85"">1:25</a> it showed the true measure of Biden. He’s acting like a schoolyard bully slinging insults. Yikes"

2330,"Biden&#39;s admin could have saved Roe but did not b/c they needed Roe to use as a rally issue for Biden&#39;s campaign. Managing the reproduction of women goes back to the US slave breeding industry. That&#39;s what gives white men agency to dictate and make laws about female reproduction.  The (D) are playin a game of take-away with female voters. If history repeats itself, Roe is a carrot Biden&#39;s ilk plan to snatch as soon as the race is over. He ran that game on FBA/ADOS voters last election."
2331,Y&#39;all voted for this dude 4 years ago. Look at what y&#39;all have done. We need Trump back.
2332,Trump is loosing his mind as much as Biden..an old man with integrity and experience is much better as president then a raving lieing nutcase as trump..?

2374,Trump should of asked Biden about showering with his daughter and making her do things she never wanted to do !!!
2375,Biden you wouldn&#39;t know what a patriot was. Trump ♥️
2376,I&#39;m a kiwi so doesn&#39;t effect me. But honestly the left are coming in hard with Trump lies trump lies. But the truth is he really strengthened the American economy strongest in years. It&#39;s not an opinion its a fact. I work in finance and during his 4 years the economy over in America grew and grew. Regardless of who you like and dont like. Surely at a time like right now you would just want a Donald Trump in charge? Its the perfect time for him to step in. And 4 years goes and its all over. <br><br>You guys cant be enjoying this inflation crisis I know that much.
2377,"This debate greatly exceeded my worst nightmares.  Biden was embarrassing to listen to.  It was clear he had no business being on that stage.  And frankly, I’m disappointed that the party didn’t find a way to convince Biden not to re-seek another term.  For the most part, I liked Trump’s demeanor and he seemed vastly more energetic than Biden.  But, it was frightening how easy it was for him to tell lie after lie.  I used to be a never trumper and vowed to support whoever runs against Trump.  But after watching this debate, I find myself in no man’s land, unable to vote for Biden either. America is better than these two individuals.  God help us.   Oh - kudos to CNN for fairly moderating this debate.  Very well done.  For those that said Tapper should have called Trump out on his lies, I disagree.  That was Biden’s job, and he didn’t make his case."

2418,WE NEED TRUMP
2419,Bidens a joke he needs to go to the nursing home already
2420,Everything is more expensive now than ever before and not in just the US it&#39;s happening all over the world. <br>The reason for this because the governments were giving money out to the citizens during Corvid and now the governments are collecting. This was inevitable.
2421,"I apologize I shouldn’t be calling names, but I am very passionate"
2422,Whos Riden for Biden? 😂

2424,Trump train coming!!!
2425,I dont really know what he said at the end of that sentence. I dont think he knows what he said either 😅😂😂😂😢

2427,And they want bullying to stop 😂 but allow these grown men who’s supposed to be leaders and role models go up there and bash each other when there’s waaaay more important stuff to talk about .
2428,That’s all you are is malarkey Biden I will not even say president because you are not my president or represent me in anyway! The only malarkey is you
2429,"Just listening to Biden speak, I have to wonder, why he always uses curse words?  It really shows a lack of intellectual acuity."
2430,We need a president like Joe Biden
2431,"I am a combat vet and all I can say is that Biden is lying. Trump might not be the most honest person in the world, but we were much better off when he was president. Biden is a joke. You are spewing out falsifications! Biden"
2432,"What are we doing about black families? Okay... what are we doing about Asian families, or Mexican families, or wait... white families?<br>I don&#39;t understand how this isn&#39;t racist or unfair to everyone to give so much of our focus on one racial group with the most resentment."
2433,"China is waiting in the corridor, old boy.  Don&#39;t think for a minute that the US power isn&#39;t on the verge of serious compromise."
2434,I wonder if any dems switched sides after this
2435,Biden is a robot he never blinks.
2436,"I love America and I will say I am part of the problem.  I am a non-voter because I don’t follow politics much and never cared too.  I am 30 years old and I have never voted.  I apologize to all that it has affected. <br><br>I am a veteran who served 4 years in the military.  As a veteran, I am disgusted on the decisions Biden has made.  With the news going on in the world, I’ve noticed we were on the brink of WW3 BEFORE Trump even said it.  <br><br>13.. 13! Of my brothers and sisters died under the “care” of Biden’s presidency.  And it makes me sick thinking that this is the man running our country.  <br><br>Not again, because I’ll be voting this year.  <br><br>I made this comment not for debate, but for an apology to be made by me. I am truly sorry."
2437,"Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe"
2438,"Biden wouldn&#39;t last cuz of how senile he is getting, so we&#39;d end up with kamala and though im not a fan of her particularly it would be better than if it were trump"
2439,"I am a combat vet and all I can say is that Biden is lying. Trump might not be the most honest person in the world, but we were much better off when he was president. Biden is a joke."
2440,Manchurian candidate 😂
2441,"Talking about health care. The majority of people I know and my family has lost their healthcare. We pay almost $1,000 a month for healthcare so thank you for that Biden."

2448,"I’m a soldier have been for a long time. I would never serve with the commander-in-chief named Biden! Trump, sir I will serve you anytime any place at any moment"
2449,What about all those children immigrants that went missing under Trump? He lies about everything and deflects certain questions because everyone knows why we are in this war. Trump was responsible for January 6th and he still will not take responsibility. Trump the liar and thief.
2450,Trump lied practically every time he opened his mouth. We now know for certain Biden can count to 3.
2451,Jill Biden shame on you.
2452,Biden a joke WORST PRESIDENT EVER
2453,"If Biden wins again, we know this election is rigged. We all know so many people who want trump back in office and WILL make America great again. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#TRUMP2024</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23maga"">#MAGA</a> we need our country back!"

2457,Where’s the 30-40 year old bright minds to choose from ?
2458,You should be prosecuted!
2459,"I really don’t believe that anyone is trying to end late term abortions. That has never the issue. It’s unseats of! There has always been rules in place regarding abortion and what term it can occur and in what circumstances. It’s a mute point, but it’s unfortunate that this is even an issue. We women are the only ones with along with our primary physician who should decide what’s the best and safest course of treatment."
2460,Y’all if a man this old is running why can’t a 25 year old…also is RFK out of the running so it’s for sure these two again??IM MOVING AWAY FROM AMERICA
2461,What is on trumps head? A wet rat or a possum. 😅
2462,Biden is still going because of Dark Magic
2463,The idea…number one…the idea…the idea…number one…the idea…the idea…
2464,"Biden killed this debate, can&#39;t wait to vote for him again. He has made my life so much better"
2465,I wish someone could have helped Biden!
2466,"By you , Biden!!!!"
2467,This is like comedy for the rich! 😂 👀 🍿
2468,Trump looks good 82
2469,BIDEN IS DONE😂😂😂😂😂😂😂WHAT A CLOWN!😂😂😂
2470,Never thought Id miss that &quot;CHinah&quot;
2471,biden is basically dead. my god. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 🙏 PLEASE SAVE US
2472,Funny reflection!!!
2473,This version has been edited to remove displays of Joe Biden&#39;s mental lapses I saw during the live event.
2474,"Please remember that we just caught isis terrorists entering into the United states biden is a clear liar and has been lying to our faces for years <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1373"">22:53</a>"
2475,Biden what a liar yoy ket theses criminals come in ..wth
2476,BIDEN IS THE BIGGEST LIAR IN AMERICA
2477,I mean Joe!
2478,The only time either one of them tells the truth is when he calls the other a liar. <br>As a country it&#39;s shameful that these two are the best we can put up for president.<br>Lord help us.
2479,"Holy buckets, listening to Biden talk = <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wordsoup"">#wordsoup</a>"
2480,How rich are you Jose?
2481,"I understand and respect Biden&#39;s political views more than Trump&#39;s, but I feel conflicted about Biden continuing to work instead of retiring, especially considering his health. It&#39;s disheartening to see Trump supporters making fun of him, as I wouldn&#39;t mock Trump if he were in a similar situation. At the end of the day, we are all human, and regardless of our political differences, it&#39;s crucial to show empathy and refrain from making light of someone&#39;s health."
2482,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=660"">11:00</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=673"">11:13</a> basically  ended Biden&#39;s campaign."
2483,See how sharp Trump is? On point like never before
2484,Joe Biden is no longer with us. It’s sad for him to be declining like this. But it’s even more sad that he has the codes to the nukes. He can’t articulate a simple point in 5 minutes. If Kim launches a nuke at us can he decide what to do about it in 5 minutes? We are in serious danger because of this decrepit and senile man.
2485,Can someone please put Biden in a nursing home?
2486,What a clown should well done
2487,Let’s be real. We all watched this just to laugh at the both of them.
2488,Biden is fear mongering by saying Russia would attack NATO countries. Russia knows what that would mean and they don&#39;t want that.
2489,"BTW, let’s not forget all the news reporters that have knowingly lied to us about Biden, his son, Obama, the Republicans and definitely maligned Trump."
2490,I gotta say Biden sure knows how to count to three
2491,Trump must be stopped at all cost
2492,Us Americans need to seriously realize how much worse the economy got once Biden was elected. It was almost instantaneous. This is genuinely scary with the direction the country has gone. I’m not sure I’ll want to live in the US anymore if Biden gets re-elected.
2493,Still talking about abortion.... unbelievable
2494,Biden was night and day when he came in spoke in NC for his Rally. He most definitely taken some sort of drug to get a boost.
2495,This is exhausting.
2496,Biden is joke da da da joke
2497,Hobby Hobby😅
2498,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=670"">11:10</a> This is how people who are under demonic possession sound in the horror movies that I watch."
2499,Does biden even know where he is at...
2500,Biden is a liar he wants to cut Medicaid and Medicare
2501,Let’s not forget the high gas prices! A jar of peanut butter is now 11.99 and up. It’s ridiculous!
2502,Biden looks like a cartoon from South Park
2503,Joe has a earpiece and notices
2504,After this debacle who still voting for Biden? I’m certainly I’m not but I’m just curious how many of you actually are that brainwashed 😂
2505,What a joke.
2506,How about no not taking you wages
2507,"Health insurance is a joke my father can&#39;t afford it ,he own his  social security."
2508,Trump! Let’s go!!🎉
2509,Donald Trump 2024<br>America wants you Don
2510,There&#39;s nothing great about the change in Roe vs Wade! How about let women decide what they want to do with their own body!
2511,Biden vs trump is like Lamborghini vs honda civic....... Remember Trump is Lamborghini here😂😅
2512,Biden is cooked ngl
2513,All i know is im 24 and these are the only two presidents who have actually effected my life and i can say without a shadow of a doubt that things were much much better four years ago
2514,Why joe look more evil than trump??
2515,Idiocracy
2516,"Trump had the build up of money for our country from Obama. Under Trump, the Republicans wanted to end Social Security. He wanted to force people back to work. Our country experienced a jump in drug addiction. Most citizens were hopeless and depressed. Trump and his cronies ripped off our country by taking private vacations on the people&#39;s money. filling their coffers with the American money."
2517,Trump 2024
2518,😂😂😂😂😂😂 Number 1. Biden is such a joke. Number 2. He has lied his whole political career. Number 3. Djrjfjdj hesuudj hdud hh hdjd hydbdh hdg. Number 🤔🤔🤔🤔 What comes after 3😂😂😂😂😂😂
2519,Pathetic Bumbling Biden!!!!! He says things without saying anything a true corrupt politician
2520,"I’m from nyc what did trump lie about crime is crazy in nyc they in hotel getting free money 1,500 a month come on I left nyc  it’s so bad in nyc border jumpers running manhattan"
2521,Where are the Biden supporters? Who stands. By this man dont be embarrassed now
2522,"Health insurance is a joke my father can&#39;t afford it ,he own his  social security."
2523,the IDEA the IDEA... baked

2534,Making jobs for Americans from all around the world 😅
2535,So funny Biden can’t talk they cut him off thank you cnn you and Biden a fool hahahaha
2536,And biden’s talking about lead pipes in homes???? That was taken care of in the late 70’s or early 80’s ???? Just another incoherent statement spewing out of his mouth that has no basis in reality????
2537,Biden’s dumb the more he talks the dumber he gets
2538,Bye bye biden!
2539,"Im no conservative, but Biden is done 😂"
2540,"Biden is very delusional to think President Trump was the worst President.. We were doing great when President Trump was in office, and now with Biden in office we are struggling!"

2543,"“If” Biden actually does win the election, we know 100% our votes mean nothing"
2544,Joe ruined my country!
2545,"I believe we are way too focused on the parties. Democrate Wilson administration create Jim Crow Laws and Democrat party Harry Truman abolished it. So why do we focus on what party is right for us? Do our votes alone changes laws, views, or actually have any physical change? <br>While an executive order can have the same effect as a federal law under certain circumstances, Congress can pass a new law to override an executive order, subject to a presidential veto.<br><br><br><br>Congress is a bicameral legislature divided into two equal institutions: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Each state sends elected representatives and senators to Congress. Although the House and the Senate are structured differently and have their own roles and responsibilities, they work together to pass legislation. No bill can become a law without passing both houses of Congress. <br><br>The president is just a face basically a fall guy for the decision made with the true powers at be. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23presidencyajoke"">#presidencyajoke</a> <br><br>I see a pattern:<br><br>1989-1993	George H.

2546,THESE ARE OUR OPTIONS!??!?!??! we&#39;re cooked.
2547,If this were a battle to the death Biden is already there 😂
2548,"Here’s a thought, make everyone vote in person, then no one can claim a fraud!"
2549,This cements all Americans perspective that our current administration is out of control
2550,Joe is suitable for president if his a  younger. But for today situation were near in world war 3 i want thrump to lead this situation.
2551,Latinos for trump
2552,"The bottom line is I’m making more money now but I can’t afford groceries, gas, and barely make my bills. I’m not happy with Biden and this did not help."
2553,Trump 2024
2554,Biden goes down.. looks like trump 2024! I bleed red
2555,I’ve read comments for at least a half hour and have not seen any one agree with Biden. They might disagree with trump and Biden but NO ONE is defending Biden. Is the writing on the wall clear enough yet? The left is actively trying to destroy everyone in Americas quality of life and ability to be free

2561,We just can not go through another Biden administration. Joe Biden as president is just running this country. Joe Biden needs to be fired in November.
2562,If anyone thinks these illegals will be staying or voting they have another thing coming. Look at him he could care less about us. I cant afford to lie anymore. Its insane
2563,No its a scam other countries paying off biden and his family facts..
2564,"How can the democrats continue defending him ,?  I don&#39;t hate Biden I sorry because hes a victem of elder abuse. Also how is he speaking so clearly all of a sudden ? I honestly wonder if dems have stooped that low they would do such a thing as give him amphetamines."
2565,Joe is suitable for president if his a  younger. But for today situation we’re near in world war 3 i want thrump to lead this situation.
2566,It&#39;s a little annoying that they&#39;re allowed to dodge questions.
2567,Joe Biden don’t know where he is at and all he ever said is trump is lying but in fact Biden is lying just as always!
2568,The 45th president..why would you say that??
2569,Health coverage?  Nope.  Lie.  I got receipts.
2570,I thought our president is still young.  Now he sounds like 116 years old. We need a younger candidate to go against Trump.
2571,Trump has my vote... that&#39;s that with that

2576,"Our economy is a disaster because of you Joe Biden. You, Joe Biden have destroyed our country. We need Trump to put it back together, and he will do his ultimate best to fix the problems you have caused in the United States of America."
2577,"Either way, abortion is murder."
2578,Biden YOU are the one lying.  You think your commie China buddies who installed you into the presidency are going to succeed again.  Tell your buddies the Rockefeller&#39;s that their day is done.  You can&#39;t assassinate President Trump the way you took out JFK.  We know regular democrats and republicans are different sides of the same coin.  The Rockefeller&#39;s and other international financiers who really run the system are so scared of Trump they&#39;ve been doing everything to try and destroy him.  Watch how quickly this reply is deleted.
2579,what PLANET is Trump on?

2581,"I&#39;m a Hispanic kid that lives 30 minutes from the border deep south Texas. In 2022, I almost lost my life as I got jumped by 2 illegals and 2 other Hispanics. We call those kinda guys cholos where I&#39;m from. Trump is not lying. The border is awful and the sad thing is, I&#39;m not the only person in my city to have been attacked like this. Biden is such a big lier, he even belives his own lies. I have family that also have been working with border patrol since 2008. They would also backup my statement"

2591,Biden kies about our veterans
2592,"Biden is the best choice for the average American Citizens, Vote Trump..!! LOL"
2593,"If the tax system was fair, it would be a FLAT TAX, and no refunds, tax credits, shelters, etc. And instead of taking it when we&#39;re making it, they&#39;d take it when we spend it. No matter how you made that money, everybody&#39;s gotta eat. We are a nation of consumers. Get it when we spend it, and make it the same rate across the board. The exception being corporate taxes. Huge multi-billion dollar corporations that make their money off the blood, sweat, and tears of people that they pay peanuts to by way of comparison of their profits versus the wages paid to the people killing themselves to produce for them.<br><br>We get hit with so many different taxes right now, both when we get paid and when we pay out for everything, that the average American is paying nearly 50% of their income to taxes in one form or another.<br><br>The Boston Tea Party was about a 3% tax on TEA! One thing! TEA!<br><br>THREE PERCENT!<br><br>Let that sink in."

2601,How can you tell that Trump is lying? His lips are moving.
2602,"Why does Biden want to do this? He should take it easy and get plenty of rest,meditation ,room service, cute nurses and discuss about life and heaven with them."
2603,I am a Democrat. Biden should hand over his position to another qualified Democrat.
2604,This is truly sad.

2615,No women or patient first. We make decisions not the doctors
2616,I support President Biden. The way he speaks is unfortunate. I went to businesses school and i believe Trump is competent. I need President to he replaced. We need another Democrat to go against president Trump.

2629,Yes trump he so right
2630,Hmo  health care is a mess we have no right ti change doctor
2631,"You could literally feel the effects of the Biden administration increasing the taxes on businesses. That’s when inflation went up, and all the prices increased. Businesses no longer had more money to make more revenue, and had more consumerism. Trumps party did more for the economy and giving out those stimulus checks than Biden has. As soon as they took office everyone’s stress levels went up and so did their bills"
2632,Biden is ready for neuralink...
2633,American voters are facing with two choices:  1.  An old man with a bad debate performance   2.  An old man who is a pathological liar and a convicted criminal.
2634,"Exactly,yes Trump"
2635,"If they are doing all this for our veterans, then why can&#39;t we get real doctors."
2636,Black family&#39;s? I can&#39;t afford groceries either! 😢
2637,Biden looks dead. He can&#39;t talk and every time he says trump is a liar he&#39;s lying. If you do your homework and not just get your info from the news you know he&#39;s lying. So bad. EVERYONE HAD $ WHEN TRUMP WAS IN OFFICE. WE WERE BUILDING A WALL TRUMP HELPED THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS.
2638,What are &quot;the illegals&quot; everyone is talking about??? Do you not understand that immigrants have it insanely difficult?? How on earth could they be &quot;running the place&quot;???
2639,"Out of 300 million + US citizens, you telling us there are no other best potential presidential candidates?! This is sad for Democracy. To be honest, Trump way way better than Joe ….just saying from what I see on this debate"
2640,No solutions being said on asked questions.

2660,What a joke. WHY ARE THERE ONLY TWO PEOPLE ON THAT STAGE!? SCAM.
2661,Did anyone notice Biden’s demeanor?  He could barely talk but today he spoke today and his voice was in full strength.  They said he had a cold.  I see why now Mr Trump wanted a drug test but I am wondering if last night was Biden’s normal.
2662,"Oh my Gosh Biden belongs in an old age home he is non coherent, babbling mess, his wife should be ashamed of herself allowing this old man to be humiliated."
2663,Americans are surely over these two debating yesterday.  Suggestion: at the forthcoming Democratic Party Convention how about kicking Biden to the kerb and placing Californian Gov Gavin Newsom on the card.  Americans are starved for choice and it’s time for something new on the menu.  Newsom 2024!
2664,Trump won and I can’t even be mad about it. He made so many relevant points

2673,Biden: &quot;The idea&quot;   8k times.

2676,"Trump&#39;s, that&#39;s a liar. He lies all the time, and people believe him."

2678,😂
2679,"I was waiting for Trump to say, “Tell us again about your uncle being eaten by cannibals” or asking “Is it true that your daughter wrote in her diary that you used to shower with her” or “Why do you sniff little girls?”"
2680,"The life of Millions of People should not be glambled with by Political entertainers, rather specialist from each branch of Military intelligence and scientific community, experts in the each independent Matter"
2681,Biden is a Disgrace
2682,Why would his family allow him to do this debate or even have such a stressful job with his health issues.

2692,Biden just can&#39;t form a full and sensible sentence
2693,Joe need to go home
2694,People who will vote for Biden would be the most stupid people on earth.
2695,WHY do you create a false idea that peoples vote and opinion matter..? at the end the majority- the loosers will be oppressed by law enforcement and still have to pay taxes...
2696,He is not even the president. You cheat in school what happens? So biden created to gain ???

2710,Ladies and gentlemen. You&#39;re looking at a reanimated corpse.
2711,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=968"">16:08</a> oh my GOD HE SAID IT HE SAID IT AGAIN. I had to check the date on this video- could&#39;ve sworn this was a clip from the 2016 election season"

2727,"I&#39;m a Canadian, and life was better under Trump, even for us. Our oil and gas industries were picking up, big projects planned and underway; all killed by Trudeau and Biden as soon as Trump was gone."
2728,Trump calling Biden a liar! Trump is number one liar. Biden just needs a room in an aged care home and Trump needs a room in Hotel Jail
2729,"What or who is Biden staring at to his left? Trump is obviously on his right, the moderators are in the middle, and there is no audience. Did someone sneak in with a teleprompter?"
2730,I pray Joe walks I. Front of my dear stand! Just saying
2731,Biden’s cooked 😭🙏
2732,"I believe we need new, better choices for our President. There are younger, less controversial, and brighter people that can lead us to a truly better tomorrow. They say not to settle for someone you don&#39;t truly love, so why should we settle for someone to lead our beautiful country?"

2741,Sigma
2742,"Trump is subordinate to an Ex-KGB Agent Vladimir Putin thru Melania, He uses fearmongering and speaks of America being self sufficient and isolationism when in Truth its survival depends on Keeping America uber All at a global scale, economically and Militarily"

2744,Isn’t Biden the one that pushed “ just put a little bleach in your arm”?
2745,"Ok, let me tell you about the job market and the unemployment situation since I have first-hand experience with that - I worked at an unemployment state agency from early 2015 until February of 2019. I am also independent, not republican, not democrat. <br><br>When I started in 2015 during the Obama second term, there were so many unemployed people filing claims, we had no room in the resource areas and we had to set up computers down the hallways of the building to handle the crowd. After Trump became president, the number of new claims  started dropping and in late 2018 and early 2019, the unemployment building looked like a ghost town - there was nobody, no claims, nothing. When they were saying that the unemployment in Florida was down to almost 0%, they were telling the truth! <br>Because nobody was filing any claims, they laid off a lot of us in 2019 and I had to find another job. <br>You can believe whatever you want, there is one truth and one truth only! But you will not hear that from any crooked politician like Biden. <br>Politicians share one thing in common and that includes all of them , Reps and Dems, they constantly lie to the American people!"
2746,He is not in good spirit...let him enjoy the rest of his life.
2747,Excuse me???? Did Biden say everyone making under $170 k a year is or will be paying 6000 dollars a year? And not the wealthy people who make incredibly more????
2748,How can BIDEN just lie about how he has failed the USA? And our allies?
2749,We need to vote independent.  Both these guys are unfit to be president
2750,"This is ridiculous. Trump&#39;s only helping them billionaires and millionaires, not the middle class"
2751,God will punish Trump!
2752,Biden mumbling on 🙈
2753,These guys are terrible but the worst is still Woodrow Wilson.
2754,Where were Trump &amp; Biden debating today?

2770,Biden won by cheating
2771,We shouldn&#39;t have a border! Remember most illegals! Came to the United States legally! They got a visa then refused to leave ! A wall won&#39;t stop an airplane!
2772,I think biden thinks he&#39;s in a 2020 debate. He doesn&#39;t realize he is the president. They should real be ashamed at the way they make this man look like a goof. That&#39;s how much they think we are stupid.
2773,This is wht you vote for?😂😂😂
2774,Trump calls Joe... Bradon 🤣😅😂🤣😅

2776,Donald Trump is really a man without a country because he turned against the  laws of America. Donald Trump has no like us. Donald Trump turned against the country that he had and should be charged with treason.
2777,Biden sounded really sick that&#39;s a bad sign. Trump is still evil!
2778,theres no way biden was able to remember that
2779,I can’t believe this is the best USA can do

2782,"Hmmm , let’s go to the cnn hosts about climate change, they “ last year was the hottest on record “ but when you look at the actual data it was in 1936 as the hottest year in a hundred years!!!!"
2783,Mr Trump is so tired! He needs to rest and relax! He can get a little more rest soon!! ❤❤❤
2784,"How about a guy that says he work a great deal of business, when he personally went bankrupt 6 times. By the way I wouldn’t understand how the US citizens would elect a person that suggested that Covid could go away by injecting bleach into their veins."
2785,Biden didn&#39;t even seem like he&#39;d live through the whole 90 minutes.. I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t fall again.
2786,This guy is literally our president RIGHT NOW.
2787,WHY dont you ask Trump to explain his plan or what he would offer Putin in return for a Peace Agreement
2788,How can he say that everything trump says “is a lie” that’s wild….
2789,Our country is cooked.
2790,Biden sounds like he doesn&#39;t even have the strength to SPEAK!
2791,If the judicial system had dwelt with Donald Trump as they should have the American people would not be going through this  mess with Donald Trump now.
2792,Biden saying Trump is lying about illegal immigrants killing citizens. As if NYC and Chicago doesn’t exist.

2805,The idea of Biden talking like he is gasping 😂
2806,Either biden has a teleprompter or he was given the questions in advance so he could memorize his lines
2807,Like Fauci represented big pharma; Biden represents BIG Government.
2808,"Biden advisors told him to label Trump as a liar.... now the main stream media, Jill Biden and other radical democrats are calling Trump liar.... the American are fully aware that Biden is the liar."

2812,Black people are killing each other because they have throughout history they have had to complete against each other other because they were so disconnected and discriminated against.
2813,Biden looks like he might not make it through the debate.  So sad.
2814,“We worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement” it also costed us the condition of our country’s well being
2815,How many new wars under Trumps watch Joe? <br>How many humanitarian crisis?<br>Who drained the oil reserve?<br>Who killed our energy independence?<br>Who tore up the international remain in mexico treaty?<br>Who supports DEI and men conpeting in womens sports and invading their bathrooms and locker rooms?<br>Who supports the climate scam?<br>Whos printing money?

2830,"This is like 2 Roosters in a hen house squabbling with no point, no answers, no resolution, just pointing-the blame, misdirecting, and deflecting issues. I don&#39;t think any of these questions were actually answered. - That&#39;s politics for you..."
2831,The stuck on stupid faces Biden made during the debate are hilarious

2838,Both are showing incompetencies…. Shame on America
2839,You&#39;d have to be totally brain - dead  NOT to notice the American quality of life has been already flushed down the toilet compared to how good we all had it under Trump  before the disaster of Biden happened.
2840,Donald Trump turned his family into criminals with him.

2850,"It was a very good debate. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉<br>Whatever the analysts got to say, this voter liked the debate."
2851,Where is the young people in this country? Do you think we don’t have enough good people to run America? I’m almost 50 years old and can’t do what I used to at 40s
2852,"I do not think Biden did such a bad display in this debate. If you listen to Trump, he only comes with lies and semi-truths throughout, while Biden comes with facts. Yes, he mumbles and stumbles but the world is much safer with Joe Biden backed by good helpers than a rogue Donald Trump with no direction of leadership and only thinking about himself."
2853,Middle school popularity contest. Beyond pitiful.
2854,Biden looks like John McCain wearing a Biden suit
2855,Um wow
2856,Donald Trump is not smart enough nor educated enough to negotiate with other world dictator.
2857,"Thanks to the Dems, no one believes in a fair anything, let alone an election. They cheat at everything right in front of us."
2858,"Regardless of political beliefs, how can you look at biden and think hes in good enough health to run?? Absolutely nuts. Im personally a republican, but atleast find a candidate that can formulate a sentence. Our national security is in danger with him being president"

2865,So is biden just listing all the thing ls he shouldve done during his presidency 😂??
2866,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=2032"">33:52</a> there’s no way."

2871,We need trump ssi is already bad
2872,Biden should go with the song “I Started a Joke” as his campaign theme. It fits perfectly.
2873,And Biden asks for money below this??!!😂😅😂🤣
2874,"Dood, he just said Intercontinental Mustard!"
2875,"For once, CNN should get some credit for not being absolutely corrupt and actually letting people talk. Obviously only 1 person on stage who can talk fluently, but.<br>Even a broke clock is right twice a day."
2876,The way that Biden walks is very close to a walking corpse.  He can barely walk an inch every steps
2877,"The fact that I had more money when Trump was president and now I’m barely making it paycheck to paycheck while Biden is president just goes to show that Biden isn’t doing anything good for me- inflation, taxes, food prices, gas prices, etc.. Biden saying he’s helped the middle class people, in his words, “is a FLAT OUT LIE.”"
2878,I did not know they made a 3rd sequel to Grumpy Old Men!
2879,"More evidence that America is not run by the executive body, but by the bureaucrats behind the scenes."
2880,We’re so cooked.

2882,Biden is a liar and there are poor white people to
2883,"With the state of the world today, President Biden proved last night that we cannot give him four more years. He has deteriorated so much in the last four, that four more would be scary. <br><br>What we saw last night was not a deep fake...it was the reality of the leader of the Democrat Party. And looking from four years ago to today, it is obvious President Biden&#39;s condition is progressive.<br><br>There are things I do not like about President Trump, but compared with what I saw last night from Joe Biden, well, the choice is obvious."
2884,Trump 2024..... Diden go to bed u can&#39;t even talk ...you are the criminal lier..
2885,My condolences to America
2886,Dictator never allow the people to have enough to take care of their needs. Babies have always been a profit to those in  power because they become workers.
2887,There is no way Biden didn’t get the questions in advance. You know he already knew what the questions were going to be a week ago just like Hillary Clinton.
2888,Biden looks like a deer staring into car headlights throughout this entire debate
2889,Trump 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 we love you
2890,"Robinhood means well; however, Trump is really more efficient &amp; effective. e.g. Fareign affairs.😮"
2891,Sadly Biden has shown how much he’s fallen and can’t even be coherent in anything???? The lies he says and his own lies he spouts every single time he speaks 🤮🤮🤮🤮
2892,"I&#39;ve held my vote for years. It seems I will vote for the most likely person that may live for another 20 years. Also, I like my racism overt, not covert."
2893,Thumbs  up  Donald Trump. Allowing Biden to talk. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
2894,Does anybody know who that person on the right is. I don&#39;t recognize him?
2895,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1977"">32:57</a> I find it odd how they specified Hamas killed 1000 but they just refer to Palestinian casualties as “thousands” not tens of thousands, not 37,000. Complete disregard for Palestinian life"
2896,Billionaires have always lived of the backs of the poor. Billionaires should always pay their fair share.
2897,Poor Biden need to go sit down and knit
2898,Even to bring product in from other countries is more costly.
2899,"Donald Trump or the lyer continued to lie to the American citizens to vote  him into the Presidencial office.<br>However, he has shown his inability and  incapabllity running the presidential office in 2016 to 2020, he was very much incapable of running the nation. With that the Americans  voted him out in 2020 presidential election.<br>The Americans  and the world witnessed your incapabilities/weaknesses running affairs of American people."
2900,"Love you Joe, but do us all a favor and step down"

2913,This is just embarrassing
2914,"They&#39;re only three years apart, age-wise, mind you. 😸"

2928,"Donald Trump, I really hope voting isn&#39;t rigged again."
2929,U S troops sloppy withdrawal fr. Afghanistan emboldened Putin! Woh.🤔
2930,"I love american politics. Its amazingly entertaining. Now, as far as a 24% tax increase to pay down debt and help social security goes, that like Elon musk selling real estate at his VIP Hotel on Mars with a view of the earth.<br><br>Most people dont realize the US is the most taxes country in the world. The government was smart enough to tax everything you all do instead of creating one big tax. Now back to the paying down debt nonsense. If the US brought in another 20 trillion from taxing people to debt and death, they would find some war to spend it on . If the US really wanted to cut the debt, Ukraine and Israel wouldnt be getting close to a trillion is 4 years and the defense budget wouldnt be a trillion but since I dont pay tax and I try my best not to pay taxes, I dont care"
2931,Biden can hide his own easter eggs
2932,If biden wins again  itll be 100% proof the election is rigged.     And our votes don&#39;t matter anymore
2933,I call it &quot;Biden Migrant Crime&quot; gotta love TRUMP😂

Trump  say it well at @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=5010"">1:23:30</a>"

2944,I can&#39;t believe that Biden lied so much about so many things. It would take a book to prove how much he lied to the people.
2945,Over 300 million citizens and this is the absolute best the Divided States of &#39;Murica can cough up as candidates?
2946,That is so true Trump.. complainer Biden . Can&#39;t believe Joe 🤣
2947,I don&#39;t think people understand the gravity of last night  . I believe it&#39;s extremely accurate to say nearly every bad thing going on in the world biden is or has some serious responsibility for
2948,This is just two grandpas competing at Storytime. 😂
2949,Everyone in this comment section is ignorant and silly. No one is actually listening to what each person is saying. Trump is literally spouting random lies and not even answering the questions. Sure Biden is slow and stumbles on his words but at least the things he says make sense
2950,Joe Biden is cursed. He has the innocent blood of the unborn on his hands. <br>No one can escape God&#39;s judgement not even a president.

2964,We just need new blood and not old blood. If times are changing so are the citizens
2965,Them approaching the podium looks like a SNL skit 😩
2966,Trump is actually very sharp and does not seem his age .... There is no denying he beats Joe 1000%
2967,That Right Trump. Joe is so bad..
2968,Like Robin Williams said 10 or 15 years ago rambling Joe Biden
2969,Can you add subtitles for Biden? Even swamp people had subtitles. I had no idea what he said half the time

2977,"Trump’s tax cuts helped my family, a middle-class family making average money we saved literally $5000 a year in taxes when Trump is present. Our taxes have gone up $8700 a year since Biden."
2978,Trump looks good for his age
2979,Sorry my grandfather met that man Joe biden&#39;s a crook my grandfather knew him when he was the governor of Delaware and all he ever told me is this man was a crook and he was only ever going to be a crook

2982,Biden looks like Mr burn on Bart Simpson.
2983,"Trump is energetic, sound and accurate, but Biden is sorrowful and crying. 😂"

2990,There is 1 person that can point out “Crazy is what crazy does” and that is Michelle Obama. She is respected and admired by all. The MAGAs would crawl back under their rocks 🪨 where they belong.
2991,"About the economy… Prices went down under Trump, prices go up under Biden. Chump made the prices almost dropped instantly, Biden has increased the prices gradually. It cost me $120 to buy groceries for one week for one person. During Trump, I could buy the same amount of food for about $85. Gas is now $75 to fill up my tank, under trunk I can fill up my tank for $31."

3039,Waste if time and old joes breath hard to understand joe if at all .
3040,Senator Josh Hawley can be an excellent candidate for PRESIDENT and I&#39;m sure there are more.  Why do the American people keep closing their eyes and allowing political parties to stick to expired past presidents that made their turn and time?  It&#39;s unbelievable and the world has been seeing the USA with lies of these past presidents supporting Ukraine giving them billions and weapons out of the American people&#39;s mouths.  The same applies to Israel!!!
3041,"Father God, help AMERICA REMEMBER your laws, and commands!!!😢"
3042,How many ideas Joe got? He kept sayin the idea in almost all the responses he gave😂
3043,Im not a wealthy person and I found myself actually making money when Trump was in presidency.
3044,Hey guys we’re not doing this again! BIDEN WAS BETTER
3045,Trump&#39;s right  ! ...no county respects us because of Biden.
3046,My favorite line of the night. “Let’s not act like children.” Boom! 🤣
3047,Trump 2024
3048,Trump!!! Is right. Biden is to old and doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on half the time. Biden drove this country in to the ground being a Democrat puppet. Bring Trump Back!!!
3049,the fact that trump was commenting on biden&#39;s dead son and biden was yapping about afganastan makes me concerned for the future of america. can i move to russia?? at least there the leaders dont have a college degree in yapping
3050,"If this is thebest of America, the &quot; west&quot; is fooked"
3051,I mean this is the leader of UNITED STATES 😂😂
3052,Why is Kennedy not here?
3053,China has America by the dollaries
3054,Afghanistan was a warzone before trumps time
3055,There was no USA war under Trump joey😮 Joe he could speak and read. You speak of morals!!! Please tell us about HUNTERS presidential protection.
3056,"Ugh! As a democratic President, I would think Biden wants a continued Democratic Presidency over another 4 years of Trump and would do whatever it takes to secure that future. Does he really think he’s the best horse to run in this race? We’re supposed to trust him to make the best possible decisions for our country but he decided to run for another Term. Can we trust him to step down if it’s in our best interest? It’s nothing personal against Biden…it’s about strategy. Dems need a powerhouse ready to step up, who’s clear on the issues and concisely delivers the people’s message. Someone loud enough to silence Trump and maybe even get thru to a few of his followers."
3057,Climate <br>Change <br>Is<br>A<br>Fraud
3058,"If they weren&#39;t allowed to prep or bring notes, WHY DOES BIDEN KEEP LOOKING DOWN AT THE PODIUM?"
3059,"Way to destroy the hegemony and influence of the USA in the world: vote for Trump. You save money in Ukraine, but Russia expands around the world, recreating the Soviet Union. China will attack Taiwan, humiliating the USA. In 2050 the USA will eat Arabic food, speak Chinese and have technology from Bombay&#39;s Sillicom Valley. Fifth or sixth power in 2100. This is an experience that we Europeans know well: if you leave room for other powers, they rule in a few decades you country."
3060,THE IDEA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3061,"Middle class was doing great under Trump. Businesses came back, highest black and hispanic employment in history under Trump. NO NEW WARS. Biden is owned by China."
3062,"Poor guy, he forgets things, he should retire and enjoy life while he can, 🤙"
3063,Most ridiculous ever .. please don&#39;t bomb us
3064,Is there not one person that wants this job other than these two?
3065,LET&#39;S GO BRANDEN!!!
3066,I voted for President Trump and I don&#39;t know anyone who voted for Biden!

3075,2 old man...omg help us
3076,Keep on and vote for Biden = democrats! Please I do scream from Sweden !!
3077,and Biden says he&#39;s Roman Catholic?!
3078,Y is Biden wearing a pro Trump flag on his coat
3079,Biden is unfortunately too old to be the next president and Trump is the worst living Choice!!!  I think a miracle is needed… there is no way one or the other can lead the most important country in the world!!!! God bless America!
3080,Biden looks like the perfect character of a senile old man in a comedy movie. Like he&#39;d fit perfectly in a national lampoons movie the way he just stares into space and looks absolutely lost standing still not speaking! I think I&#39;d feel bad for him if he hadn&#39;t spent his whole life being such a corrupt piece of scheisse! MAGA!!!!!
3081,Biden why dont you just quit and go home
3082,Can a rule be set to actually answer a question that is asked..?
3083,"I just realized around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=3390"">56:30</a> they changed the angle on Biden to try and make him look less like an exhausted geezer that wants to go to bed."
3084,Is it possible that the USA has none better than these 2 past presidential candidates?
3085,I wish they would mute trump when ever he starts lying. But I guess then there wouldn&#39;t have been any Debate  at all because every thing trump said where nothing  but lies.
3086,Can I become president 😂 this is like playing whose line is it …  no one has answered any questions
3087,God it’s truly hard to understand what joes saying I hate that someone that is that stupid can run a country
3088,I&#39;m glad Joe sunk himself. Because he can&#39;t make a complete without having to stop and look stupid to giving a answer that is false
3089,"Biden added 15,000 manufacturing jobs?Really?where?I dont see it.I have a technical degree and cant find a job to save my life.Biden is the real lier here.I know people that dont like trump,but all I know is that while trump was in office there were jobs everywhere and gas was under $2.00/gal and food was much cheaper.And most of all much less government intrusion in our lives.For God sake,the FAA is trying to regulate my model airplane flying hobby"
3090,Biden has a terrible cold
3091,900 bucks to a disabled couple Is not even a night in a motel room ...if they wanna survive ...the rest of the month
3092,Democrats worried scared they&#39;re in trouble and more people Democrats are going to turn towards Trump for help make America better.<br> stop help!
3093,100% agree with trump on jan 6... ruined lives.. for people who wanted to be patriotic
3094,"trump spoke truth, democrats cope so hard."
3095,Biden why dont you do all americas a big favor and just leave the whitehouse and dont look back
3096,"We live in a nation of well over 300 million, and this is the best we can do as far as the Top slot in the Federal government?? Biden please I beg you! in the next few days announce you are withdrawing from the race- you are guaranteeing Trump a second term if not! we need two open conventions this year GOP, and Dems!! would like to See De Santis vs Newsom in Nov!!"
3097,Joe the joke
3098,"Trump <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1911"">31:51</a> people dieing needlessly stupidly <br><br>Freedom is not needless or stupid <br><br>And Putin has been attacking his neighbors as long as he has been in office. The idea he attacked Ukraine because of Biden is asinine.<br><br>Trump is not a president <br>He is a glory hound."
3099,Anyone else notice that Biden looks like he had a stroke   look at the right side of his face
3100,Wonder how many women have aborted Biden’s?
3101,Trump and his whiners 😂
3102,Trump For Prison 2024
3103,If Biden believes we are a great nation and the Amrican people will stand...but his actions SAY SO MUCH DIFFERENT !
3104,"The American people deserve better than this 2 party system that we currently have.  It doesn&#39;t matter which party is in power.  The people get less and less.  No one changes the government to help the people of this country.  Take away the legal tax breaks that the rich people and wealthy companies get.  That is where the money goes, and of course to our legal and know military, plus the black ops funds that no one even knows about or monitors.  <br><br>Stop getting us into wars abroad.  We shouldn&#39;t have gotten into the war in Ukraine.  It is another unwinnable war.  Billions are thrown down the toilet, and more money keeps going down the drain.  While not popular, I feel the same way about Israel.  It is a corrupt government.  It is another conflict that we have no business being involved with.  Let the people of the region determine what the future is the region.  We keep sending our men and women to war.  We do nothing for them when they return, physically and emotionally devastated.  Stop sending our people into other conflicts.  I am a senior and nothing since Vietnam can justify our country going into regional conflicts.  It is not our business."
3105,"I can&#39;t wait for Saturday Night Live this weekend, I&#39;m sure there will be a great skit."
3106,We’re not giving Biden 5 dollars . President Obama.
3107,"Biden calls Trump an alley cat?  The man who had an affair with a married woman and broke up a marriage,?  Joe and Jill went up the Hill...the rest is history."
3108,Doesn&#39;t he mean sick care.. you body in a harpsaccord
3109,"At about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=4314"">1:11:54</a>ish, you can hear what sounds like Trump letting out a wet fart."
3110,"Tell me so that I understand, how can a debate that is televised so the public can see  allowed one person to  tell systemic lies and not be checked. These people are supposed to be the elite, the Paragon of our Democracy.  To sit and listen to direct questions be ignored, deflected  and answered with disinformation undermines any integrity. I don&#39;t see how can this network  could air  a debate with one side telling lie after lie and  not be checked."
3111,The worst president in history. Joe biden
3112,Trump completely off the subject about Russia and Ukraine policy
3113,"Better not cut Social Security, all the year&#39;s we put in for a and giving it away to immigrants."
3114,Biden is the worst lier in the history of the country
3115,No matter if your left or right ask yourself this question….. would trump have been taken to trial if he wasn’t going to run for president? The answers no… and for that the left should be charged for political obstruction
3116,He lies he never said that
3117,Its sad the dems keep lieing. Ans america sees their plan. The cabinet is running the country joe just repeats what hes told
3118,I&#39;ll honestly be shocked if Biden wins because everyone is saying no go
3119,Joe is repeating what in his ear not in his head qe need TRUMP A REAL PERSON IN CHARGE OF HIS FACILITIES

3123,Looks like Biden is reading. Never saw him writing anything.
3124,Debates cannot represent one person&#39;s victory or defeat. The strength of a country depends on everyone&#39;s internal unity. Respect older people just like you would respect your parents or grandparents.
3125,All evidence against joe and his family will come out and JAILTIME TO TRAITORS.  THE DEMS ARE SCARED THEY WILL BE JAILED FOR BREAKING THE LAW AND NOT FOLLOWING POLICY. LIKECTHE WEAPONIZATION OF THE DOJ
3126,Trump  doesn&#39;t scratch China&#39;s back. Trump won&#39;t have the patty cake Biden does with China.
3127,I loved it Biden looked as stupid as his economy held up by oil reserves
3128,Computer chip maker in idaho is closing there door in Pocatello Idaho it’s laying off over 500 employees in Pocatello Idaho
3129,Do they even need moderators?  AI would have done a better job.
3130,"When he moderators said,now let&#39;s switch to the middle East,what was Biden doing flipping over pages on a TABLET.Did he have the questions in advance?Rule was. NO NOTES."
3131,This is SO funny 😂I can&#39;t believe this is real hahah
3132,Trump will take away Medicare and Social Security
3133,Good gosh put a man on the pidium for joe. He is a disgrace. He sold us out to china
3134,"Even Biden supporters should be in shock. I feel bad for the guy. Democrats had NO ONE else? this is insane. I support Trump, however I think RFK should have been allowed to debate."
3135,Stupid joe.
3136,No it hasn’t there still having high bust and a lot of fentanyl is still making it to idaho
3137,I love how Biden promised to do things if he was elected for a second term like he wasn’t already in office. It just shows you what he could have done while in office.
3138,Biden has giant cue cards  on the podium or an ear piece ..bc he has never said #1. #2. #3. ever like this!!😵‍💫
3139,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=384"">6:24</a> Trump 2024"
3140,Traitor joe
3141,Why do many Americans think inflation is only happeninng on their soil and it&#39;s the fault of one president or the other? This is a worldwide problem due to the complex nature of global trade. Personally I feel that Trump was exagerrating and lied a lot and Biden on the other hand clearly had problems speaking. Which is the lesser evil? I only watchd the first 50 minutes
3142,"Biden looks dead and propped up on a stick 🏒.  Seriously, not joking. He looks dead."
3143,"Re first question: The both walked to the podium seemingly mumbling and without energy, LOL? I wish we had some other contenders and meanwhile…..Trump as usual talks in vagaries while Biden gave specifics.  I expected to be upset by Binden’s abilities and instead his very first response to economy question included so many specific numbers and clearly laid out what has been done and what is still left to be done. People half Binden’s age couldn’t have done 1/100th as well yet rattle off vague criticisms comments; too many in generation “raised” by “We want our MTV and chicks for free..”  are often not much more than professional critical commenters , nuance apparently too much work and many older folks too tired and entrenched to bother with nuance either. Trump talks like he is speaking to drugged grade schoolers with instead of specifics and numbers he only says same old things “We”  bla bla bla “Great” /“Greatest in history” bla bla bla “Everybody amazed” “Copied us” “A lot of credit” “Everything was rocking good”  and is has more concern with who gets “Credit” than delivering any specifics.  “Spent the money” to (implant fear here ) avoid Great Depression and with senasationalistic language void of specifics wastes precious time with “The likes of which we had in 1929”…really we needed the date?   Yeah ok IF the f’n stock market was higher at end of T admin than precovid that only speaks to one factor and again no specifics about how much higher like Biden had about his talking points.  Anyway meanwhile AP news with headlines portraying Biden as doing badly; never donating to them again. I can’t watch the rest of this given so clear in one answer the blaring difference between these two."
3144,Joe biden treasonous traitor selling america to china
3145,Wouldn&#39;t it be hilarious if  biden walked over to Trump and sniffed him 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 <br>    Im sorry i couldn&#39;t help myself.  Trump 2024 🇺🇸  🇮🇱   🇬🇧
3146,“And by the way….” 🙄

3156,And a dementia patient
3157,Cnn treasonous mouthpiece of a treasonous cabinet
3158,"Biden looks confused.  Plus Biden doesn&#39;t seem to be on his game.  He comes across as almost senile.  I voted for Biden.  But, after our southern borders have been left open.  Why do we need to provide housing for illegal immigrants?  I am a senior and can&#39;t find low-income housing.  More aid to the illegal immigrants than to the vets and US workers like me who became disabled and went through all my savings.  I can&#39;t find low-income housing or afford food. I can&#39;t afford to get my teeth fixed.  I mean basic care.  Cavities, and more extensive work like root canals.  I can do nothing about it.  A horrible way to live."
3159,Biden is killing US
3160,Its really painful to watch. They both are just too old to be a leader of the most powerful nation in the world !! But I agree Trump is much sharper than Biden. I cannot believe that US Constitution do not set an age limit to be a President ?!
3161,Cnn pushing the lies of a treasonous cabinet
3162,Wow! Biden doesn’t blink

3166,Bad luck for America both candidates are too old<br>I wish we had someone littile younger
3167,Isn’t Joe Biden trying ban ar guns
3168,"Trump already answered he would accept it if it&#39;s fair and honest. You should have asked Biden if he would accept if Trump wins. Make sure to change code for nuclear bombs before election please. I don&#39;t trust Biden. We the people have been severely punished  since his first bad approval ratings. He has punished us for years by stopping construction of the wall, allowing terrorists in, giving illegals our social security and Medicare, keeping us in fear of war, allowing extreme inflation to the point that we can no longer afford the American dream."
3169,This is the leader of our free nation? I am falling asleep. Shame on his caregivers!
3170,These candidates should be alot younger. Why cant president&#39;s be 35 - 50

3174,The really sad part is I agree politically on more issues with Former president trump than I do with President biden. The problem is.  trump is a criminal. trump exaggerates. trump outright lies. But worst of all he takes everything to far. He doesn&#39;t know when to quit.
3175,Trump&#39;s facial expression are is repelling as what comes out of his mouth 🤮🤮🤮

And that he only made the official announcement earlier than anyone in most of history because the indictments were coming fast and he NEEDED to be a candidate to craft his paranoid narrative?<br>Watch it several times, it is clear nonsense."

3227,"This is not funny at all. This is elder abuse. Biden had his run, he needs to enjoy the rest of his life. He isn&#39;t mentally fit enough to be a president anymore. To be fair, a lot of people don&#39;t know he overcame a really really bad stuttering problem in his youth. It&#39;s understandably coming back now that he&#39;s a lot older. It does make him look bad to those who aren&#39;t aware of that. Really really sad to watch"
3228,Is so easy to see that Mr. Trump is more intelligent than Mr. Biden please america do the right decision if you are a democrat or a republican you know that is only one person to fix america don&#39;t vote just because you are republican or democrat do the right vote you know that Mr. Trump care for america and he will fix our country

Then George Bush Jr. And the Republicans privatized Medicare and Medicaid making the whole process harder on seniors.<br><br>Food stamps. Aid to something like 44 million Americans, including seniors and veterans, was cut off by Republicans shortly before covid.<br><br>Does Biden look bad just 10 minutes in? Yep.

3283,"People stormed the capital Jan 6th because they thought Biden had cheated on the election. Because they thought democracy had been stolen from Americans. If Biden cheats by telling illegals to vote, supplying them with social security # so they can vote, allowing them to register to vote, and if he counts them toward electoral, I think we will see way worse than Jan 6th."

3295,45 min - Biden is so right - trump the psycho face revealed
3296,"Though Joe is clearly fighting death every sentence. And very weak points, or lies rather"
3297,Trump always beats Putin to the plate. The whole reason Putin invaded Ukraine was because he saw what a weak incompetent president Joe is after the mess in Afghanistan and saw it as an advantage to restore the Soviet empire. He would have never dared if Trump was there.
3298,"Orange man is truly a genius, at first I was thinking why orange man acting so calm n presidential, but by the end of the debate I noticed what he did, he let biden talk, he let the world see with their own eyes how bad biden really is.

Then Under BIDEN&#39;S ADMINISTRATION ..HOW THEY HANDLED GETTING OUT OF APHGANISTAN AND LEAVE ALL THAT MILITARY EQUIP BEHIND TO OUR ENEMIES ( MILLIONS OR MORE !) NEVER MIND OUR  MARINES KILLED AND PEOPLE HEARTLESSLY LEFT BEHIND, OUR OIL RESERVES SOLD BY BIDEN&#39;S ADMINISTRATIONS...IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO RUIN THIS COUNTRY...JUST THE LACK OF DISCIPLINING OPEN BORDERS AND RESTRAINING BORDER PATROL ...I REALLY THINK TREASON COMES TO MIND IN HIS PERFORMANCE AND HERS.

3343,So many intelligent and great people throughout this country but this is what weve served up. This is the ultimate contentions we come up with. This is our &quot;democracy&quot;.
3344,"Are you moderators not allowed to fact check these people? You should be. If the Trump supporters tell him to say the word arguably before all the stats he spouts off about being the best in the country, he couldn&#39;t be called a liar now could he?"
3345,"I&#39;m no Trump supporter, not even american, but how can anyone there vote for senile Joe after this."

3350,I love Trump
3351,This feels like a game show
3352,Can someone do a full fact check on both candidates live thought the whole debate.
3353,"The only Comeback that Joe said clearly is, “Everything he said is a lie…..You’re a sucker &amp; a loser!” I couldn’t understand what he was saying at all. This is embarrassing…smh."
3354,Joe looks lost walking in
3355,Biden is joke😂😂
3356,"Be honest, we knew Biden would be destroyed by Trump. 😂"
3357,"I love that Joe said Trump ruined the economy, and it was horrible when Trump was in office, and thats why there was no inflation while Trump was President. Lol"
3358,"Biden does not understand what causes inflation!  The more money made available, the higher the cost of everything.  Read &quot;Whatever Happened to Penny Candy&quot; and you will know what I am talking about.  TANSTAFL - There Aint No Such Thing As A Free Lunch."

3373,Biden you’re working so hard to make things worse and make people suffer that’s what you are doing.
3374,"What it was Trump versus Hillary we should have realized that it was going to get worse Trump is it the best also isn&#39;t the besr choice. Either you need to vote for a third option, ELECTORAL COLLEGE. Or we&#39;re done."

3376,Yeah. Yoyce been riding the that gravyvtrain for decades Joe.. Pack up..And get your Ensure on the way out..
3377,"Look at Biden&#39;s face whenever Trump speaks about the border and the horrible dangers, etc. Just look at him! The devil knows when he does wrong.

3389,"President Biden talks strategy for American people. The problem at the border has been going on for 30 or 40 years, there was legislation sent to the house to representatives to start to correct the problems at the border.

3411,Crony Capitalism..
3412,Actually on second thought he did a pretty good job because he knew that he violated his own constitutional beliefs
3413,Trump is hoping that everybody is stupid cuz everything that came out this m***********&#39;s mouth was a lie.<br>Obviously the Republicans have short attention spans and don&#39;t realize and remember that it was the worst economy in Trump&#39;s term. Everybody lost jobs. Everybody was sick. Everybody was dying 🤦🏽
3414,How does a tv show host do all that oh wait like he build that wall Dudes throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks😅😅😅

3421,😂😂😂😂
3422,"This is absolutely awesome because what he has said is true for Israel. What he has said is true about China, under Trump. China was allowed to bring in even more imports. into the United States, while they refused to import our goods."
3423,Biden could wrap his own birthday present and still be surprised when he opens it. 🤔
3424,hoover was the last good president we ever had
3425,"The question should be put to Mr Trump, the former President.  Exactly how would he stop the war between Ukrainians and the Russians?"

3431,Battle of the aging😊
3432,"From a fair look at this debate I start with the fact I dislike when anyone in a debate doesn’t address the question asked. For that I am disappointed in Trump’s portion. Equally, Biden’s inability to complete a full thought is very concerning. As I didn’t have stat sheets to factcheck them both I just assume that both misrepresented their own sides. I’ve never seen a debate that that wasn’t the case, ever! I absolutely must point out that so many questions asked and answers given were incomplete and lacking the kind of information voters actually need to make a decision. Also we have Trump who is the first non politician that was faced with swimming up a waterfall his entire term. Being compared to a career politician that has been collecting a check from the tax payers for 5 decades. Big picture, successful businessman vs failed politician. <br>Old man that shakes hand with thin air vs the only president to step foot in North Korea!"
3433,Cowankers? Please speak decent English!
3434,BIDEN IS THE WORST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF USA.

3440,We need age limits on the position. How about somebody younger than both? Or maybe being present is a joke. Keep in mind the three Branches of government....
3441,This is a sorry state of afairs in America when these two dirtbags are our available options.
3442,"See again, Mr Trump blamed everyone about the Russuan question. And praised himself."

3447,6hcap 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3448,"Veterans are 100% not taken care of, period. VA care is absolutely abhorrent."
3449,"So, under Biden, the poor pay 6 percent for SS, and the rich will pay 1 percent (this has not happened and will never happen). How about everyone pays 3 percent, or everyone under 170k pays 1 and the rich 6 percent? Biden believes in tickle-up economics, where the poor support the super-wealthy. Biden for Retirement 2024."
3450,"Still no idea why democrats keep biden as candidates? First to lower the sense or urgency for trump voters like previous, that really worry the democrats, second of all if they loose they can blame all to biden… it’s a win win situation and they will get the seats as normally when people vote for republicans presidency they will vote for democrats party seats, if they win, it’s a miracle, so what’s the point of switching Biden?"
3451,Mr Trump avoided answering the questions on his information about the mass deportation of immigrants. Why does he refuse to answer that question.
3452,"Trump sent over 10 billion dollars to Israel, while Americans were doing without. Those veterans he spoke of, he turned his back on him every turn. The American people, he sold out to any foreign interests with enough money."
3453,... if Biden wins the next election the pentagon boys will give him a rubber nuclear football instead of the real one ... he&#39;s the poster boy for dementia
3454,"If you consider the amount of money allocated to the Ukraine war, Biden has the highest deficit. If you consider the social security handed out to illegal immigrants, Biden has the worst deficit. I am not even American."
3455,We have a thousand trillions eh? Lol interesting…where are they at?
3456,"That was last night. This was today. I&#39;m 86. A good night&#39;s sleep is great!<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHJoewM3WfU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHJoewM3WfU</a>"
3457,"The good thing about Joe is, if you ask him about last night,  he won&#39;t remember. 😂"
3458,Elder abuse.
3459,Biden is finished.
3460,"Social Security trust..Was..and has been plundered  y Our Dysfunctional government for decades.. Tax ,tax. Tax...Abolish the tax code. Illegally 1912-13."
3461,"Biden might appeal to many uneducated people, because he says things like, &quot;I&#39;m gonna tax the rich and make them pay!&quot;, and it sounds so like Robin Hood or something.  Truth is it doesn&#39;t happen, just sounds good to say.  Some folks think that they will profit without having to work or be educated.  They can get what others make, sacrifice, work for, and earn, by just voting in a democratic rich uncle.  I&#39;m saying this as a poor person, retired with only paltry social security.  I could have done parts of my life better, set aside more, been more realistic...but I was not!  No one should be handing me money they busted their butts for, because of my choices.  I do have food stamps and help like that, but I also plant some vegetables and can food.  I get creative and stretch my money instead of asking for others to pay. I am not for either candidate, both fall short, lie, and operate from sick egos.  But if pressed, I know I cannot reasonably or with a clear mind, vote for a person with dementia who would allow such a dingy VP to step in if he was removed.  That is as scary as it gets. I live in Portland, OR and see first hand what living in the middle of the addicted, the gender confused, the homeless, the mentally ill that have proliferated in these dark days here under the current attitudes of democrats. To do anything to pour fertilizer on that mess is asking for annihilation."
3462,They not like us
3463,Can&#39;t the American people see that if Mr Trump sends cases to the supreme court. It would not be in the best interest of most of  the people in certain states. American people better see right through Mr Trump.
3464,Why no body speak about iraq

3469,Home prices jumping 30% worked well for us homeowners.

3474,Wasnt this nation founded on political violence and rioting 😂
3475,Tariffs promote AMERICAN business. That’s an original cornerstone of the Republican Party. Tariffs protect U.S. businesses from foreign competition and encourage investors to invest in domestic innovation instead of sweatshops in Vietnam. The trade deficit is largely a product of unfair foreign competition with American businesses.
3476,"I am using my son&#39;s phone, this is my opinion, denise overbeck. Why should tax payers pay for anyone elses day care? Of you have kids, you should be home raising them. If you cant afford to stay home, ask your mom to sit. These people want to throw their burden on people like me, who raised my four at home and am now a senior and living on retirement and SS with a medical issue that doesn&#39;t allow me to work. If you want to have a family, be responsible enough to raise your kids, they aren&#39;t mone, or an 18 yr old working a part time job and going to school. This is a parents responsibility. I stayed home with my four, and when I was divorced and had to work, I had my family to help and I paid for child care at some point, and I had none of it paid by their father even though he was supposed to pay for half. Now asking people without young kids to support others who choose to work is as ridiculous as us paying SS to illegals, along with medical treatment and housing.....and so on. Joey boy is by far the worst president, he took the title from obama. Obamas wife did nothing as a first lady. She was his teenage babysitter when his wife was in the hospital, and looked like a fool on stage. She had a hard time trying to get him off stage. The best thing Biden had to say was on you tube, he said if you want an election that&#39;s honest, progressive and a smooth running campaign, vote for Trump.look it up. The exact wording you can see for yourself. Biden is demented, not too old, he has no morals and is dragging the Catholic church through the mud, he is  not a Catholic with his actions. Going back to the child care issue, be responsible for your own family. Until now, we did, now it&#39;s shoved on others. The ridiculous left is allowing babies to be killed after birth, I guess they had a hard time finding someone to raise their kid."
3477,back from the grocery store. I&#39;m not voting for Biden Again
3478,"... meanwhile the carefully HIDDEN super rich RULERS are  laughing their heads off at these two buffoons and ALL OF YOU BLIND TAXPAYERS.  Vote anyway you want....the super rich RULERS just DON&#39;T CARE!  <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
3479,Uncle corn pop is a straight up liar
3480,"Trump just told a lie, under his presidency we did not have the safest border. We did however have several high-ranking cartel members, catered to by the Trump administration."
3481,"I want a president that when he shakes another presidents hand they jump away and start kissing his @$$ that&#39;s not biden and that&#39;s not trump, it Obama, you know young, there&#39;s a difference and that&#39;s it"
3482,So like is anyone going to answer any of the questions asked? Because what even was that
3483,"Lies, lies, Hamas was started by Obuma, so was BLM ..all started by Obuma, that was part of his job to divide us with blm"
3484,The proof is in the pudding when Joe Biden take office he ruined everything everything went up and now Trump he&#39;s going to brings everything down just look at the past it&#39;s all right there in your face people
3485,Trump is deflecting questions and sometimes goes off course and Biden and mumbling and Fumbling! They might as well call Bernie!
3486,It&#39;s so sad that people in this country believe in both of them. They&#39;re both clowns Biden can&#39;t form a sentence and Trump is an insane liar. Yet the people in this country are in love with both we had competent people on both sides that should of been president but people are insane the Trump lovers and the Biden lovers.
3487,Biden is &#39;weaponizing&#39; DOJ against his chief 2024 rival. The USA turning into a banana republic with indictments of political opponents?
3488,Both are a total embarrassment
3489,Biden is higher than cat s*** right now talking on that microphone
3490,Nothing like listening to them arguing about their golf games in a presidential debate😂
3491,Did I miss it but why didn’t Trump answer the question about what he would do to help parents for child care?
3492,Recommendation. Change the playback speed to .75 when Biden talks. At least you can parse  the gibberish. Its still gibberish though.
3493,us democrats are gonna be staying home We don&#39;t have a candidate.
3494,"Okay folks what we have here is a debate between two men. In which neither one of them should be president. they are nothing, but a puppet for the parties they represent. These two men are proof, the there must be age limits for those running for president. In fact there are several,good old boys. that must be removed. from our governing body on both sides."
3495,How can people think Biden is competent to be president still? Mind boggling
3496,I made 50 dollars over for food stamps from 600 to 175.. I have 2 kids but a single homeless qualifs for 275 for one person.  Smh. Crazy prices are insane and government help is not reseting the standard to qualify for help.  How can people raise kids working 80 hrs a week.
3497,This was a good joke 🤣🤣 two clowns 🤡
3498,&quot;Cleaning the swamp&quot; is a dirty job.
3499,Biden&#39;s answers looks very memorised. CNN clearly handed the questions to the Dems in Advance. Yet  Biden still mumbled and stumbled
3500,Trump is the only president that had a show making fun of him Our Cartoon President
3501,Breaking news: This just in. Black Caucus responds to presidential debate.<br> [x] Vote None of the Above<br> ~Brewsters Millions
3502,FENTANYL MACHINES????
3503,100% voting for Trump.  On the SIMPLE FACT our country is in disaster with biden. At the end of trumps presidentcy the only thing people had bad to say was about his tweets of him just being honest calling out idiots.
3504,😡democrats are embarrassed now I am joe&#39;s a joke😢
3505,Corporate greed ...for sure what would Trump say about that
3506,Biden contracted himself in this entire debate and made it easy for Trump
3507,"WAKE UP AMERICA , CAN YOU NOT DISCERN THE LIES BEING SPEWED FROM THIS QUACK OF A PRESIDENT ????  LIES LIES LIES ....GOD KNOWS WHATS GOING ON IN THIS SO-CALLED ADMINISTRATION &amp; HES THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN FIX IT AND CLEAN THE SWAMP !! ALL GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST 👏🙌👐🤲🙏"
3508,Joe biden qote &quot; when kids touch my legs it makes the hairs stand up&quot;
3509,Biden has no clue what is actually happening to this country.
3510,Trump is OK with his foreign policy.
3511,🇺🇸❣️T❤️R❤️U❤️M❤️P❣️🇺🇸 should’ve brought up Joseph Biden Jr.showering NAKED w/his DAUGHTER Ashley TO HER HORROR making her shower late late at night when &quot;Dad&quot; would be less likely to be awake
3512,BTW I thought the Monitors did a very good job ...tolerating Trump&#39;s rantings yet require he answer the question. CNN has been pro Trump and derisive of Biden and perhaps they let Trump go too far into his personal pixie-land but all the same were firm.  I thought that sometimes your cut off of Biden was severe...but because Trump seemed to be given more leeway in his madcap behaviour and his obsessive ranting. Thank you for the way you generally conducted the &#39;debate&#39;. .
3513,Joe you’re the LIAR
3514,"USA has 341,799,656 population as of june 28,2024, question is: Aren&#39;t there any younger politicians to run for President of America this coming election? by the way too hard to watch Biden standing for an hour, it&#39;s insane."
3515,Biden is a liar
3516,Did anybody count how many times Biden said &quot;the idea&quot;?
3517,"blubbering, lies, blubbering, lies....lies....lies...blubbering......OMG"
3518,SUCH  a NEGATIVE debate... just insulting each other. Nothing positive
3519,"I&#39;m pretty critical...not savage but to the point in criticism of the &#39;key players&#39; creating havoc around the world. I have perhaps raised awareness with some people concerning the environmental costs of Putin and netenyahu&#39;s genocide blowing material contaminated soil, chemicals, poisons and bugs around the world. into all our nostrils and throats. I have delved into the history particularly concerning Zion-Israel in Palestine. I have given my opinions as well as facts when even Palestinian representatives seem incapable of understanding, or wanting to do so, that the zionist invasion of Palestine did not begin in 1948. &quot;Rothschild had for decades been financing jews or zionists into Palestine but the swamping began with Hitler, the Reich, the British Government , the zionist leaders in 1933 when the &quot;Transfer Agreement&quot; outcome was to stop the BDS against Germany...a promise not kept. <br><br>I wrote of the fact that Palestine and Jordan were promised unconditionally to &#39;the Arabs&quot; in full control for their service under Lawrence during WW1, and how the zionists schemed to stop that and take the land, and did so. I have tried to encourage research instead of the way October 7 2023 is put by governments. ..that Hamas plotted, trained and one day burst out of their concentration camp to try to destroy &quot;Israel&quot;. That was not the case and I put a scenario of collusion with Trump and netenyahu in 2019 to provoke an armed response.<br><br>Moving now to Trump and Biden in debate. I saw and heard nothing from Biden which was or will be harmful to America yet I now despise him on one particular basis, his conniving in the Palestinian genocide. He struggled a little sometimes but I can&#39;t accept that he showed a lack of depth or ability to communicate. He&#39;s an experienced politician knowing the why&#39;s and wherefores&#39;s of government. I feel many emotions in his excuses and efforts to enable the Palestinian slaughter and the 24/7 horrors of noise fear, grotesqueness to continue and not step up and stop it.<br><br>Trump on the other hand I found spooky. He was aggressive and tried to avoid answering questions by railing against Biden for questions already answered. He was obsessive. He lied relentlessly and played to the cameras and his supporters, childishly pulling faces and often looking like and as dumb as Alfred E Newman of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine. He made claims about Ukraine including one slip-up that he had consulted with Putin before the invasion of Ukraine. Trumps manner is &#39;attack&#39; and the way he does it is through transference...if he accuses a person of a crime it&#39;s one he has himself committed.<br><br>When he accuses of &#39;interference&#39; in the political process it is what he himself does...and so on He had a secret meeting with Putin and then when the invasion began in his &quot;Reagan Vs Carter &quot;style disingenuity, and deception was shown on TV as extremely pleased on hearing Russia had invaded Ukraine. He praised Putin for &#39;disciplining&#39; the Ukrainians...a concept he and Putin must have discussed in secret. He accused Biden of blackmail which he had never himself done.... he claimed...<br><br>Trump welcomed the invasion of Ukraine because his demands and efforts to bribe the &#39;secret documents&quot; on Hilary Clinton be given to him. He also welcomed the invasion which was held off until the end of his term as I see the idea as Putin awaiting Trump&#39;s return to &#39;order&#39; Putin to desists or alternatively if the election went &#39;belly up&#39; for Trump it could then be put as Biden&#39;s fault. <br><br>Trump accuses Biden over &#39;wars under his presidency&#39; yet I think it evidenced that Trump was involved in supporting both genocides. He plays at being upset with netenyahu, my suggestion is that could be over Trump thinking he was going to be offered &#39;development&#39; in Gollan Heights or in Gaza..or both....and netenyahu had backed-off.<br><br>I think given the seemingly two horse race for Presidency that the safest for the world vote is for Biden. Trumps grandiose clams to instantly stop the invasions of Palestine and Gaza ring hollow. If he has a method...disclose it...if not then it&#39;s just another lie amidst his thousands of others. I think this a quiet time thinking for Trump...the extreme fantasist.<br>The lunatic is in my head<br>The lunatic is in my head<br>You raise the blade<br>You make the change<br>You rearrange me &#39;til I&#39;m sane<br>You lock the door<br>And throw away the key<br>There&#39;s someone in my head, but it&#39;s not me"

3529,"President Binden, like most people&#39;s has to think before he answered delicate questions truthfully. Whereas  Mr Trump just would not answer, but threw blames on the present President and also Mr Obams the president before him Mr Trump. The former Prediden just blamed, blamed, blamed accused, accused, accused. And praised himself for everything, even for firing personnel."

The ones who make record profits but less sales and don&#39;t pay their employees their bonuses or the ones who are up charging in all their products just because they can 🥴🥴 and why the heck when we are so in debt and americans are struggling would you continue to allow people from other countries to come here or continue to give other countries money !!! Make it make sense !!!
3534,"Biden saying Trump wants to cut the cops!? I remember only the Democrats crying for defunding the police. How can anyone with a quarter of a brain, not see these blatant lies."

Biden has been busy working for us in this country for his term and doing a great job Trump on the other hand has been busy in courts for all the felonies he&#39;s caused for himself and you believe what Trump is telling you in this debate 😅.  What a joke Trump will tell you anything you want to hear he needs to stay out of jail  that&#39;s why he needs this presidency so he can stay out of jail and also get retribution.

3665,Wow.. Biden is an absolute imbecile who got more lies out than complete sentences.
3666,Trump reminded people of what Biden did badly in his first year.
3667,America is doomed at this point
3668,"its funny that Biden&#39;s mic was on when he entered and we nor the CC could figure out what he said while trumps was off when he helloed the moderators, then Biden waved to an empty audience."

3679,AMAZING!!! Lord help the United States and open up blinded eyes.
3680,Isn&#39;t it racist to enact government policies that are intended to benefit a specific ethnic group? Why can&#39;t we have policies to help the poor regardless of their ethnic background?
3681,"Biden talks about Putin being a war criminal. When he parked a hellfire missile, in some innocent families car during the withdraw."
3682,"he has been working for 4 years to lower the price of gas, housing and groceries hahaha what a joke this Biden guy is, so 4 years more and the price will be down? yeah right same with Obama higher prices in everything"
3683,I feel like Biden said futin instead of Putin
3684,I nominate the actor playing Biden for an EMMY!
3685,Theses guy&#39;s are terrible i hate this
3686,USA need new jong president
3687,"All I know, withTrump the mullahs of IRAN are finished"
3688,There are four hundred million people in that country ...is this the best they can do ...
3689,"As a Canadian, I feel bad for my American neighbours. Having to choose between these two is absolutely terrifying 😳 Biden is hardly coherent and Trump is just spewing a bunch of exaggerations and lies. This is terrible. How are these two your best options!? I&#39;m genuinely concerned for you guys.."
3690,"For God’s sake, step aside Joe Biden!"
3691,I wisely watched the Robert F.Kennedy version of the debate last night and Mr. Kennedy easily out performed either of the two former political party candidates. Too bad the DNC and RNC are dying organizations and don&#39;t even see it!
3692,I want to say that even doping could not help Biden in this debate.
3693,Can&#39;t take Biden seriously.
3694,Why are the American people not demanding to have Kennedy included in the debate?
3695,Trump 2024
3696,You are ACTUALLY crazy if you’re still voting for Biden. <br><br>⬇️Vote for Trump 🇺🇸 button⬇️

3703,"Enunciate, Joe! We can&#39;t understand half of what you say because you don&#39;t enunciate and talk so fast. You stumble and mumble and waffle. You are a joke Joe!"
3704,We&#39;re about to watch our beautiful country crumble I feel it coming guys they lie to us blatantly and we allow it they spend billions to finance wars we shouldn&#39;t be involved with. ..... with our money people they can&#39;t afford to help millions of homeless Americans.... wake up people wake up 😊
3705,These questions are weak. Same divided distractions that have been shuffled around for years.
3706,Don&#39;t let that Baby killers sponsored pathetic Joe Biden win in this upcoming elections<br>Any Trump card  press the 👍 button
3707,For 51 years the nation support Rowe vs wade but the democrats also supported slavery for longer than that. Slavery was in place for 246 years. Obviously we’re all wrong over time.
3708,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=4919"">1:21:59</a> Trump&#39;s statement with actual passion vs Biden&#39;s reaction braindead reading the teleprompter"
3709,Please retire
3710,Is malarkey the trigger word to take a shot of liquor?
3711,Can even stand to listen to the fumblm thing people are calling a leader what a disgrace to our country
3712,"he said Joe Biden was the 44th president and donald trump the 45th isn&#39;t it true that biden is the 46th..... <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a>"
3713,We need to stop paying taxes

3715,You got that right Mr Trump and I tell you what I get 500 calls a day how about that Medicare in Obamacare try to shove that stuff down your throat and I&#39;m tired of it
3716,I can’t believe Joe said he didn’t lose any troops. You are the commander and chief and didn’t realize you lost troops. Yeah go ahead and apologize to their families of the fallen Joe.
3717,You got that right Mr Trump and I tell you what I get 500 calls a day how about that Medicare in Obamacare try to shove that stuff down your throat and I&#39;m tired of it
3718,Trump and his administration was on the move. Most areas was blooming till Biden and his corrupt folks took over. Biden has been in Washington since he was a teenager. Nothing has improved under Biden. He is just a puppet. Biden knows he has to go retire already. Let our President Trump continue to make America great again.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
3719,Why does Biden look like a ventriloquist doll?
3720,Right on Trump!!
3721,I can&#39;t understand Biden. Is he speaking the English? Trump is dodging questions yet responding to Biden like he can understand his gibberish?  What went on here?!
3722,Trump destroy biden
3723,I though Biden did a good job.
3724,Everyone talking about their age but Trump sounded more articulated than most will in these comments 😂 idk about biden tho
3725,"Under trump my husband was able to solo income bring us into middle class, he makes $10 more an hour now then under trump, we are struggling now more then we were under trump and gained 50k debt.... f u biden"
3726,No country wants to mess with us? Does anyone remember spy balloons?
3727,This is what we&#39;re supposed to choose from???? Really America wake up before its too late
3728,"Biden is weak communist Biden <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=621"">10:21</a>"
3729,Thanks to DNC for screwing over Bernie. Now we are left with this. Great.
3730,Biden looks horrible
3731,And the worst (for the demonrats) is yet to come 🤣
3732,"The fact is Trump raised great kids and he is a billionaire, he knows how to make money.  Iden son is embarrassing and Biden is not a good guy."
3733,No one admire your country…the people is only afraid of the nuclear weapons….
3734,The only thing Biden did is bring down are country and made it a laughing stock for other countries and he is one big bullkrapper
3735,Is Jesus a valid write-in? He&#39;s the only one that can save us! 😔
3736,"For those that think Biden is  not all together there. He knows exactly what he is doing, he is out to destroy America and help the rich get richer and the middle class to be poorer than the poor. If he looks and acts senile then he can&#39;t be blamed for his destruction of America. We need to wake up and realize the shape our country is in!"
3737,Biden is weak
3738,American politics is a joke.
3739,of course he asks about the capitol riot but wont ask biden about his 2nd amendment infringements😂😂😂
3740,"2 elderly standing 90 mins , its like nursing home abuse,lol"
3741,I really wish Deez Nuts was running again. I seriously think he’d have a shot this year.
3742,Where do I find the truth based on reality anymore
3743,What about the rising housing cost.?
3744,Biden sucks
3745,RFK
3746,"Listen carefully at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=4314"">1:11:54</a><br>What do you think that sound was?"
3747,Tuh tuh tuh TODAY JUNIOR!! 😂
3748,ABORT A BABY AT FULL TERM IS  DISGUSTING
3749,"Its not due wide spread theft, its due to the incompetent president! Thieving is off the hook because people can&#39;t afford to eat or live because every thing is priced so high. What&#39;s sad is Biden is putting illegals in posh apartments and giving them food stamps and our People legally here are starting to be homeless and hungry. Be scared America!"
3750,Trump sounds articulate. Biden sounds worse than usual. I think regardless of which party we are all in we need to make the best decision for our country.
3751,I don&#39;t know should be president. At least I know who shouldn&#39;t.
3752,Anyone else wondering why Biden kept saying period? Repeatedly and almost randomly?
3753,"The real Joke is Biden &amp; 16 staffers spent over a week with the questions in hand and he still couldn’t do it. Big difference then Biden reading off Prompter. It should be criminal what they are doing to this man and the country! The Dems could have did a primary and had a capable candidates, but they prefer someone the radicals can manipulate."
3754,That elderly man has been advocating US’s best interest. No wonder we are at our worst now.
3755,Apparently only black mothers matter
3756,I can’t understand what Biden is saying
3757,Biden&#39;s mask needs to be ironed regularly...
3758,Trump is the biggest liar i have ever heard. Biden should never have to listen him. Pure evil.
3759,Biden is out of topic
3760,We are in a housing and cost of living crisis. We need affordable housing Presidents
3761,"I only see RFK as the real option here at this point, period"
3762,"Trump had a 2 trillion 💵 deficit because of the covid-19 pandemic, giving financial relief to the citizens of America 🇺🇸"
3763,"I am so annoyed at both of these men, neither one deserves to be president, we have to find a president who works of the people, by the people and for the people, we have to return to the America that was in 1943 a juggernaut of manufacturing, innovation, political might around the world, we have to stop medaling in other peoples affairs, you don&#39;t build a house from the roof down , you don&#39;t build a strong economy from the super rich down,  if the super rich did not have us to buy their items or services then they would be as the rest of us, to build an economy that is self sustaining you have to make sure there is no more poor in America, Stop the geocidal war on the middle class and the poor, how much money do the super rich need, it becomes about power, the poor and what is left of the middle class are becoming exhausted watching the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, The great experiment is on the verge of failing if we do not be careful"
3764,The idea..that they allowed Biden to stand up there and struggle to formulate a sentence for over an hour is insane.
3765,jb is moving his lips you know what his doing ;
3766,For clarity where did the $200 billion dollars that the Biden Administration has given to Ukraine originate?  All the hard earned work and misuse of our tax money has been given away and We the People will never see any signs of it returned in the future.  The tax paying citizens of The United States taxpayers were never given an opportunity to question the free money giveaway of their money to Ukraine.<br><br>The fact that Putin is a war criminal is irrelevant.  How the United States engages it&#39;s adversaries is what will determine if we participate in a possible World War 3.
3767,President  Biden🎉💯
3768,Let’s go trumppppp
3769,he looks and sounds like ?????
3770,VOTE TRUMP
3771,"This shouldve been co-hosted by fox news, or some republican network. Stop cutting the man off!"
3772,BIDEN OVERFLOWS OF POOP !!!
3773,Team Trump ✌🏻👏🏻 from Germany
3774,Liberals are evil liars.
3775,Trump lol &quot;let&#39;s not act like children&quot; coming from the LEGIT BIGGEST CRYBABY TODDLER IN THE HISTORY OF FOREVER!! 🤣🤣🤣
3776,You can tell joe is backed by big pharma
3777,J6ers in the wrong place at the wrong time😢.
3778,The mouth of a great liar like Trump does not bleed. Trump the Liar
3779,GENOCIDE JOE IS TO OLD AND CROOKED TRUMP IS TO CORRUPT... 400 million people in thia country and these are the only two we have ? If so America is in trouble
3780,FML why these two?
3781,The idea.. the idea..  the idea.  I lost count how many times Biden said that
3782,"Poor Biden, why are &quot;they&quot; letting him go through this? smh."
3783,Uh uh uh uh….a quote from Biden. Straight forgot what he was talking about 😂
3784,READ:  &quot;The Case For Trump&quot; Victor Davis Hanson wrote it and many other books.
3785,The sad part is any  American citizen with that many charges and indictments you can’t work for Walmart or waste management but yet he can be president THIS IS AMERICA 💁🏽‍♂️
3786,"We need a big change in Massachusetts <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#trump2024</a> 🫶🏼🫶🏼"
3787,"I can&#39;t believe Biden actual fell for Trumps thing about the golf lol. He sounds like a lonely old man who just wants a friend to play golf with,."
3788,"Biden said there&#39;s an issue with corporate greed which is Corporate capture. He&#39;s done nothing to stop corporate capture in our government. Trump said the stock market is the economy the stock market is not the economy they are two different things. Trump also blamed Biden for covid mandates but Trump was president. He could have reversed that but he didn&#39;t. <br><br>These two people are full of it. They dodged questions, blamed each other for everything, while taking credit for everything else, and basically tried to scare people about everything. Voting out of fear makes you a pawn."
3789,DJT was against NO DAPL. One of the 1st things he has signed was for the Dakota Access Pipeline &amp; tried to destroy Indigenous water. CNN news lady even said they could use a pool. A pool? She wouldn&#39;t say that if she was told to. What about the animals &amp; land if those pipes fract? Don&#39;t be on the wrong side of history. DJT want to tell people to use a rake for forrest fires &amp; at Xmas time he wants crimson Xmas trees. Smh. He only gaf about his water at Ceasers Restaurant when it was right on the other side of the parking lot of Lower Elementary School when a guy broke into beer &amp; cig stash &amp; stole his boat keys &amp; dumped it in the water all cans crushed &amp; cigs half smoken &amp; all he did was gaslighting people who told him the truth. Then he sells it in 1999 &amp; the Taj Mahal the next year in 2000. Cause people called his mother &amp; told him what he was doing.
3790,"Joey was , for once right about   Putin,      Putin wants the old USSR  back in place,   a socialist communist regime"
3791,"Funny how everything it goes back to biden he&#39;s just like, all lies, just nonsense don&#39;t listen to him. all the wile he&#39;s falling apart"
3792,"The only thing the D.P. can do is damage control. Convince Biden NOT to go for a 2nd term and take another candidate to run against that orange turd. 3 possible candidates: Kamela Harris, Gavin Newson or Gretchen Whitmer. The time is NOW!!!! With only 130 days before the election, there is not One minute to lose!!!!!"
3793,"Really sad to see such a debate and the level of emotional intelligence in such a high level discussion, shown globally. A shame"
3794,I’m just horrified. These are the options?
3795,🤢🤮
3796,&quot;look it up go online&quot; Democrats run the media...
3797,"The President said there was no INFLATION when he took over  office. However he said after that INFLATION rises,what is this President saying 🤔"
3798,In defense of them both. Why didn&#39;t the moderators Fact- Check throughout the debate?   It has been done before.
3799,"Proverbs 29:2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.<br>Proverbs 29:16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall."
3800,"&quot;Murdered by illegal immigrants&quot; Joe, that was your fault, trump wanted the wall, you put a stop to it! That ladie died because of your negligence."
3801,“We provided thousands of millions of jobs…”<br><br>-President of the United States
3802,"AHH Lads are ye serious, was going to watch Netflix, watched this comedy show instead, give two them a Zimmer frame, elect an Irish man, like JFK, Love from Ireland,"
3803,"It&#39;s not a question of whether Biden should be president for four more years, but rather for 4 more seconds.  Answer: NO.  But that, of course, would leave us with the cackling Kamala crone.  How has it come to this?"
3804,Biden sounds like he constantly about to fall asleep
3805,"EEEEEeeehhhhh....I&#39;m cringing so hard just watching this. For two reasons. (1) For Biden&#39;s performance. On it&#39;s face it was so horrible that it actually makes me feel sorry for him. Even though Biden is and has been our nation&#39;s most divisive and corrupt, constitutionally antithetical leader in our nation&#39;s history, his performance was so bad in fact that I couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for him. This must have been pure humiliation for him and Jill to watch together later, especially given all of the pre-debate prep he undoubtedly received from his handlers. And (2), Just the pure unmitigated bias and sliminess of the CNN/MSNBC team in their grotesque impersonations of journalist and impartial facilitators. Just really appalling and debased viewing here for those reasons. Watching this border almost on perverse voyeurism...ughhhh(chills of disgust and repulsion) Eeeeeeh"
3806,Is it me or when Biden looks at trump he looks dead inside 😂
3807,100-120?!! Try 100-300
3808,"Trump lied the whole way through this debate and CNN did nothing to fact check him in real time,  What a disgrace.  Furthermore, Trump insults black people every opportunity he gets. What does he mean about &quot;Black Jobs&quot; that the immigrants are supposedly taking from blacks.  I don&#39;t know any blacks out here picking vegetables. Immigrants have always been needed in the US to do those jobs,  that not many Americans are willing to do.  And as far as construction jobs, Trump himself hired immigrants to work on his projects and refused pay them,  Knowing that they had no recourse to sue, since they were illegals.. So he has to make blacks angry at immigrants thinking that they are taking something from them.  Don&#39;t fall for his hateful rhetoric. Trump says that he will fired thousands of Government worker, and they are predominately blacks, so he is saying what he plans to do and how much he care about blacks being employed."
3809,President Biden had a cold. Trump pathologically LIED the whole time. It was sickening...They both Lost....
3810,I may not vote for the first time in my life...
3811,Isreal is the worse in the world. All political and media figures have dual citizenship with who? Ohh yeah 😅 wake up ppl
3812,"I was  the head teacher of a leading early childhood center that the first initial rhymes with &quot;I&quot;... during Trump&#39;s  (and Obama&#39;s) administrations  we were able to help families apply and qualify for reduced cost. Veteran parents  made merely a token payment.<br>As well as truly working class parents . After Joe became president, the tuition rates skyrocketed,! I was no longer allowed to assist families and the only children that attended the school were one&#39;s that the parents could afford to pay full tuition. I had to leave.  I&#39;ve no confidence that Biden has any true concern for working families or our veterans."
3813,Everyone hating each other because of Blue and Red... Wake up America! Our government is the problem!
3814,We gave pawpaw the job 🤦🏻‍♀️😞
3815,Make America Great again!! Biden is chasing butterflies!!!
3816,The border patrol union literally tweeted that they do not nor will they ever endorse biden. They posted that immediately when he said that
3817,"The  Afghanistan    pull out .........Biden wanted a photo op by a certain date  to say he ended  Afghanistan ...... so to do it,  he   ordered the troops out in a secret  middle of the night  departure on a weekend,  leaving  Americans,  some soldiers, and       interpreters behind to die      .  Worse,   he left behind 80+ BILLION  of military equipment that   could have easily been  brought out........and let both  air bases  be closed  instead of  keeping them  with a minimum troop occupation for a deterrent.......... Instead, Joe  wanted his photo op by a certain date, and sacrificed  the lives of our own people........what  a joke for a commander in chief ............."
3818,Pretty sad when health insurance is expensive and can&#39;t afford let alone companies don&#39;t offer health insurance
3819,President Trump MAGA 2024 👍👍❤️❤️🇺🇸🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧
3820,Driving contest 😭😭😭 play golf if he carries his bag 😭
3821,Trump is the Man &amp; Most Fit Person For office.!!!!!!!
3822,Well I’m never getting that time back
3823,Usa what is going on this men are too old don&#39;t u have other people to run the country.
3824,go trump biden needs water
3825,I&#39;m sorry but Mr . Biden is not Fit For office!!!
3826,Joe Biden reminds me so much of my grandpa and that is why I cannot hate him. Man looks so helpless everytime but he should go and rest now😂
3827,I&#39;m excited. After Biden gets reelected it won&#39;t be long after until Kamala takes over as President.
3828,When you have an issue of open and unvetted borders it&#39;s like having the floodgates to rivers wide open during flooding season.  The obvious solution is to shut the gates and then monitor the amount of water that escapes near potentially unprotected areas.  <br><br>Why doesn&#39;t the current Democrat Administration use common sense to control these huge numbers of people Crossing our unprotected borders.
3829,Ninety minutes of fried brain cells.
3830,Does Biden realize that we were around when trump was president? 😂
3831,Dems are the party of death.
3832,Obama and Biden created the cages Bidens talking about. Where are the children theyve gathered from the border?? WHERE ARE THEY???
3833,"LOL I live 20 minutes from Mexico and have seen ZERO rapes/murders/etc caused by immigrants because Trump ALWAYS lies.<br>However, I have seen shootings and other violent acts here, committed by Americans who live in red states who want to abuse my home when they vacation."
3834,Two terrible choices.
3835,"What&#39;s going on.  That is the the first time, ever, that Biden is mostly talking co-herent.  They should have demanded a drug test.  I NEVER hear Kennedy, Johnson, Reagan, Elinhhower, any: mumble like Biden does.😢 One can&#39;t pick and choose, a president should be on his game 24-7.  Trump for 2024🎉!"
3836,Ya his brain is fried.
3837,The Democrats are not doing themselves a favor. Trump&#39;s greatest weapon in this election campaign is to let Biden speak as much as possible.
3838,"Biden is not the commander in chief it’s the CIA pulling the strings , WW3 if Biden wins oops I mean cia"
3839,THE IDEA!!!!....
3840,From both candidates: NEITHER talked what is destroying &quot;Amerika.&quot; What&#39;s destroying it is the Super Wealthy who are making untold billions $$$$$$$$s off of The US Financial Hegemon who favors ONLY the very Rich. No $$ goes towards producing ANYTHING in the US. No $$ goes towards helping the untold millions to the poor in the US. No $$ goes towards building factories to produce anything. ALL goods comes from other nations like China w/ US Middlemen making heaps of $$$s for THEMSELVES. The US OLIGARCHS own everything. They are killing America.
3841,Biden sounds like he&#39;s chocking.
3842,I don’t mind the inflation but this country ain’t headed the right direction
3843,I hate biden he has such an evil attitude. Joe is such a liar.
3844,Trump talks absolute  nonsense.   Yes Biden did a bad job in the debate. He&#39;s seems very frail. What Trump fails to realise is The world thinks the USA is a disgrace  BECAUSE of Trumps previous distarous leadership. He aims at the lower and less educated people because as ge once saud on TV &quot; they are stupid enough to vote for him &quot; his words in the 1990s.  <br>Biden might be frail and gave senior moments but he&#39;s a much better leader  and man than Trump could ever be. BUT  I think Trump will get the vote and Win
3845,Sad that this the best the country has to offer.
3846,CNN......joke of a network
3847,$120 groceries has increased min more than $200
3848,Everything always has to be about race this is a problem with America All your politics is about race and what color skin color is that is so racist because if you&#39;re not the right skin color you don&#39;t get any benefits
3849,Thanks to The Democrats America IS becoming A PENAL COLONY
3850,"all biden does is contradict himself. and we need to stop practically keeping our borders wide open. if you don’t prioritize the original citizens of your country first, you have a very unstable country if even a country at all. some of our opportunities and a lot of our jobs are being taken away from US citizens and given to illegal immigrants. wake up people. wake up!"
3851,"Biden is in UKKKraine because he has personal interests there, that is how his son Hunter got rich.  He flip-flops on Israel, he sends them weapons, he claims he won&#39;t send certain missiles to Israel because he is dodging war crimes himself.  He also claim how the U.S is loved by the world but, at the same time threatens with &quot;nobody will dare mess with the U.S, because the U.S is so powerful&quot;.  He uses the claim Putin will keep invading, this is just hate talk, the UKKKraine is home to millions of Russians, who&#39;s ancestors lived there for thousands of years, they were all Russians, they speak the same language with just a difference in dialect. They wanted their own country but thought they could have their country for free, so bills mounted, they wouldn&#39;t pay for oil, heating, gas, etc.  The U.S. (Obama/Biden) took advantage and started slipping money to them, etc.  Long story short, Belarus was mentioned, Belarus is supporting Russia, Russia has no plan to take over other countries, but the UKKKraine became just as I describe with KKK, racist.  Russia has no plan, to invade other countries.  The ameriKKKan brainwashed the UKKKraine so bad of course they come begging.  In recent years the U.S began encroaching in areas around Russia with influence and NATO being one of them.  In 1990 they seeked their own country at the fall of USSR, and were given Russian blessings, with the promise to maintain peace with Russia, the U.S began their effort to move in and suddenly Russians became targets in the UKKKraine, murdered robbed, kicked off their farms, and threatened.  This was all done with Obama/Biden/Hillary KKKlinton/Victoria Nuuland.  They complained to the motherland Russia, So Biden is at all cost going to keep the war going.   I believe Trump will stop the war, to many deaths.  This is pure hypocrisy, in other words the U.S is loved or they will become an enemy with missiles aimed at them.  Trump is correct in many of his stratigy, however, this country is populated by millions of poor, and he is a threat to the poor people, the common people with his racism, and hate of indigenous people.  Biden is a threat to world peace, Trump is a threat to the common people. Both evil."
3852,&quot;Pulling out of Iraq was the ugliest most embarrassing moment in American history&quot;<br>... He knows slavery existed right?
3853,"Trump  made an error by not   pointing the fact  it was Joey who   invited   the entire world  to freely  come  across the border......and the Constitution law be scrapped<br>Biden  not only broke the   laws  ,   he continues to  break  the  law,  thinking he can  enlarge the Dem base of voters.   Instead ,  Joey also  let our enemies to send all their  soldiers, &amp; spies,  to come  in and begin   setting up.     That is  a traitorous  act, deserving    prison"
3854,Why is there no age barrier for presidents to be elected? How can an ill man run the nation?
3855,50% unemployed during Trump? Really?
3856,&quot;On January 6th we were respected all over the world&quot;<br>Yeah... I don&#39;t think that&#39;s accurate
3857,America is no longer a great country!
3858,So true  trumps you right
3859,I will vote for Biden Even if he is in ICU. Trump and his people are lunatics
3860,At this point we have to vote for a VP that gives us hope. This is depressing.
3861,Biden has an ear piece👀
3862,"These two old guys are just arguing about who leads better. Meanwhile people are starving, need better education, and are struggling everyday to figure how to pay for things. We need a leader who is going to LEAD! People need guidance. Tell us what your solution is. A good leader inspires action to better lives for ALL. We are all humans trying to live our lives. Stop arguing and listen to the people!!!!!"
3863,Why make corperations pay more taxes??? The less money businesses have the less positions they open for employment. Besides if Biden pulls more money from them you think hes not gonna continue to just give it away to unvetted wars hes already financially messed us over for?? Bidens gotta go! Please vote Trump. Do you know any man who would want the job after what theyve put him through? He loves America...the Freedoms and OUR CONSTITUTION

Abortion is barbaric, ......  I am surprised   the point of cutting up and selling baby parts did not come up ,   (the whistle blower is still on trial for that one)"
3876,"CNN was running recon for Biden, simply by saying &quot;thank you&quot; and cutting him off when he went off subject and was drowning in mutters"

3899,Biden is doing all this and making no changes. But helping everybody else and not helping the American people.
3900,We need trump
3901,In this debate they said the same thing they&#39;ve always been saying so in this debate they&#39;re watching for strength. Biden just coming out   of the G7 summit was weak. But Biden made more sense.
3902,What have the Republicans in Congress done to fight inflation?  It&#39;s not only the president&#39;s job to fix everything!
3903,Abortion murders babies!
3904,What happens when you tax the rich?  They pack up and leave the country The wealthy and their stockholders will close businesses and terminate work opportunities.  That&#39;s what decimates communities and increases stress on the citizens and their families.  Town after town from sea to shining sea will turn into metaphorical ghost towns.  We have seen this scenario take place time and time again across the United States of America<br><br>When the top percentage of wealthy are gone who&#39;s going to be taxed next?

3922,Will somebody let Biden out of the box so I can hear what he&#39;s saying
3923,"Biden continually tries to take credit for the immediate results of Covid bans being lifted. It would be like the guy on Day-Shift taking credit for the Sun coming out, while blaming the guy on 2nd-Shift for making the Sun come down."
3924,Joe Biden couldn’t speak well.<br>He looks like sick person.<br>He should refuse to participate this debate because now everyone knows he is not capable to lead the government anymore.<br>Embarrassment of the nation.

3928,"at  15 min  mark......the issue   of  Roe sent back in the States by SCOTUS...   ......  As to Roe itself,     it is an issue of allowing infanticide anyway you look at it.  Roe was bad law on  its face, and Joey was  wrong to say  constitutional scholars were all in favor............Roe was  not decided  around the life being extinguished,  it was decided on  this subjective idea  that a womans privacy  would trump   the life of a real human being who committed no crime.     A woman   can say she has a right to HER body.....true enough.  However,    that human being&#39;s  body   growing inside, belongs to that   PERSON......and has the  right to  life   inside or out side the womb."
3929,Why no fact checking?
3930,Girl.
3931,He lies repeatedly
3932,Watching Biden I was hearing Pink Floyd&#39;s Comfortably Numb.  He&#39;s pathetic.
3933,Still I will never understand why a clone is the USA president….he is not the real one😂
3934,"That presidential debate was an absolute “train wreck”. One was incoherent and the other lied his a$$ off.  Then, they bickered back and forth about who’s the better golfer.  Like two children debating about who can run faster with their new sneakers. Such an embarrassment to the USA!"

3942,Why does Joe keep repeating his words? Why does Joe keep repeating his words? And why are some of his sentences ending with mumbles. What is he saying
3943,Thee&#39;s a reason that RFK wasn&#39;t invited to this debate. He would have wiped the floor with hem. But <br>Trump definately won this one.
3944,Answer the questions.
3945,&quot;I didn&#39;t make it up go look it up go online&quot;. Then precedes to get his numbers mixed up. Dude if this hasn&#39;t summed up the last 4 years under Biden I don&#39;t know what has.

3951,"What voters?  You mean the dead voters whose votes were counted last election?  Wow, they’re still talking?  Like Biggie Smalls, “Life after death”."
3952,Trump soll gewinnen
3953,"I&#39;m hoping (wont ever happen probably) that Jill would come to her senses &amp; put aside her love for flattery &amp; selfishness &amp; stop this foolishness. Clearly, Joe looked startled &amp; acted the part of a neurologically handicapped person, certainly not one with a mere cold. A cold doesn&#39;t affect the brain nor make one&#39;s speech slurred."
3954,"It&#39;s pretty obvious what happened: Trump couldn&#39;t care less about the facts. His only agenda was to confuse Biden, and make him look like a deer in headlights, and senile. Trump succeeded. This is incredibly dirty pool. Very sick.<br><br>Trump is the poster  child of people with extrinsic values, like the extreme right-wing does.  People with extrinsic values are strongly motivated by the potential or the prospect of individual <br><br>reward, praise, attention. They&#39;re more likely to objectify people; to exploit other people; to behave rudely aggressively; contemptuously dismiss social impacts or morality, and environmental <br>impacts. They are motivated by prestige status power image Fame wealth money."
3955,Only difference is on stage is you got one hand is a red neck out spoken racist and the other hand is a klan men in a suit and tie racist 😂
3956,"Please see through trumps lies! He dodges, deflects, lies without facts, and is a criminal!"
3957,The people that believe trump are just ignorant af all what he is saying about the abortion is just believed by ignorant people.

Farm made or homemade ice cream, but you love Bryer&#39;s ice cream. Your favorite is vanilla, but if you could have the French vanilla with the little doggy that looks like grandmother&#39;s dog then it was mine to take after her passing. Remember Booty? My grandmother named her that cause my blonde Maltese dog was such a tap dancer. I even remember you had frequent lunches with aunt also with half the time with Nancy Patricia Pelusi. Remember I introduced you to Kelsey Grammer (Frazier from Cheers) right in my aunt&#39;s kitchen? 🤭🤭🤭 You enjoyed his company &amp; talked to him many of times.

3972,Biden is dumb weak and old and has no knowledge idk who let him into office but he’s the worst. Has no guidance for anyone disrespecting trump when he did so much for us. Imagine this. If Biden was president during Covid what would he do for us.

3984,"When the owners of huge corporations have to spend more money on taxes they do, but the losses they incur trickle down to all of us. They can handle it the rest of us cant and as long as that is true these politicians will continue to blame the corporations for greed when really they were the ones who raised the taxes so they could recieve more money. So who is really greedy in that situation?"
3985,This is embarrassing and so painful to watch

3999,Joe Biden&#39;s presidency is exactly like his debating skills. No wonder why my bills and cost of living has doubled since Biden became president. Biden couldn&#39;t function a McDonald&#39;s cash register. Anyone who votes for Biden is guilty of elder abuse.
4000,"These two reminded me of class debates in middle school when the class president would promise vending machines, extra recess, etc and never delivered. Then arguing over who can golf better?? We are doomed 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️"
4001,"What we’re seeing is a gerontocracy. It happened to the Soviet Union in the 70s and 80s, and it hurt them badly. Why did we let baby boomers decide our candidates?"
4002,As a non AMERICAN I could not understand why in the world USE ONLY ONE MEDIA PLATFORM NO AUDIENCE <br>WHAT WAS THE WOKE DEMOCRATS AFRAID OF FOR ALLOWING ONLY ONE MEDIA AND A MEDIA OUTLET WHO WORLD WIDE IS NIT REALLY RESPECTED
4003,Still don&#39;t know what Trump will do in office. All he does is point fingers but we don&#39;t know how he&#39;s going to handle current problems. Every thing is wonderful. How can you blame Biden for the war in Ukraine. Trump is a poor choice for a candidate. I hope we don&#39;t have to support a President who knows nothing about issues. And to call America a third world country. America is the best country in the world even with all our problems. Trump is disrespectful to America. You don&#39;t talk down about something you love. I love America but doesn&#39;t sound like he does.
4004,"Cant afford RENTS and food, while homeless get thrown in jail and fines!!???"
4005,"Roe v Wade didn’t go away. It was turned over to the states.  If a woman doesn’t agree with the state laws in her state, go to a different state and have an abortion. Or, hey, use birth control, then she won’t find herself in the situation of having an unwanted pregnancy.<br>Trump said he wanted the PEOPLE living in each state to help create the law in their own state concerning abortion."
4006,What Biden saying germain.
4007,"Roe v Wade didn’t go away. It was turned over to the states.  If a woman doesn’t agree with the state laws in her state, go to a different state and have an abortion. Or, hey, use birth control, then she won’t find herself in the situation of having an unwanted pregnancy.<br>Trump said he wanted the PEOPLE living in each state to help create the law in their own state concerning abortion."
4008,"And this country is buikt on immigration, but flooding the border with millions when we have Americans living here, off all races that need help."
4009,Interesting conversation 😊😊
4010,That mummy is through.
4011,"Roe v Wade didn’t go away. It was turned over to the states.  It a woman doesn’t agree with the state laws in her state, go to a different state and have an abortion. Or, hey, use birth control, then she won’t find herself in the situation of having an unwanted pregnancy.<br>Trump said he wanted the PEOPLE living in each state to help create the law in their own state concerning abortion. <br>Roe v Wade had many unethical, unwanted guidelines. Late-term abortions is unethical <del>period</del> especially when a woman will know if anything is medically wrong with the child by the first trimester. If a woman waits until the third trimester to abort, she’s doing it for the wrong reasons. At that point, HAVE THE BABY AND PUT THE CHILD UP FOR ADOPTION.<br>The abort-any-time-you-feel-like-it is unacceptable."
4012,YT not letting me like comments or reply. Trying to protect Biden&#39;s feelings.
4013,Too much hatred between both parties.You&#39;re both fired😂
4014,You have never been respected Trump! No one like the USA for years but now it is more evident cuz people are opening their mouths 👄
4015,Clint eastwood ist debating Donald Trump ?
4016,Both CNN and NBC are a POS.
4017,"Well America, now we know absolutely no one was helming the boat…."
4018,What’s good with bidens chin
4019,Two things learned  :<br>Trump can Golf !<br>Biden can build Sand Castles at the beach !
4020,I know the reporters were mad when they asked a question &amp; the presidents used those moments to attack each other.
4021,Wait so black Americans are imprisoned 5x&#39;s more and they want the POTUS to do what? Stop crime? You do the crime you go to jail sorry. Or I mean you use to not in Dem cities anymore you get instantly released to do it again without bail.
4022,Biden is awesome! Brilliant performance! Best president in American history! Sala to Ukraine! Money to Ukraine! Biden 2024 and forever!
4023,"When a person with a $55,000 income cannot buy a house without paying almost $2000 mortgage payment, there is a huge problem! Pelosi took full responsibility for Jan. 6th, what else do they need to indict her? Biden cannot even be understood in this debate, and all he ever claims is that Trump lies. He is an embarrassment to America. To see a huge turnaround in our economy and foreign relations there is only one person to vote for, and that is Donald J Trump. Biden lies about immigration, foreign policy, cocaine in the white house, fentanyl at the open borders, and SO MUCH MORE. A transgender assistant secretary of health for the USA is an embarrassment. The 2020 election was rigged and a scam."
4024,"These two always attck each other on unrelated topics. Also, someone sexssss life has nothing to do with politics or how they run the country. We are turning into a 3rd world country. And I&#39;m TRUMP last election and next election. And you can see Trump is being less superfrivilois and more focused, Less arrogant this time around. Sending him to court only refined his mind. God Bless both men but TRUMP. Black people should stop enjoying living ghetto. Africans stand up and work hard. I&#39;ve lived in all black neighborhoods and they are trained to like the system. Black Americans have to choose to be better. And poor people should stop having so many children and expect everyone to pay for them. And I broke my ankle and couldn&#39;t get foodstamos or housing help when I ended up homeless. I drove people around in my Lyft that were staying in nice hotels from other countries, on my tax dollars. ItS WRONG"
4025,"Mr. Biden<br>You went home for a week to study for this debate. You had help from others, and all the questions in advance.<br>If this is the best you can bring to the table, you are finished.<br>Thanks for the effort, your done."
4026,"Let&#39;s face it even tho normal mentally stable americans have known for sometime Biden isn&#39;t mentally stable to run this country. His people and the news want everyone to believe he&#39;s the best man for the job is a JOKE. Watch after this debate the rats r going to jump ship blood is in the water, they r going to act like OMG we didn&#39;t know his mental capacity was so bad BLA BLA BLA. THEY KNOW THEY HAVE KNOWN SHOULD THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA B PANICKING??? U TELL ME?"
4027,The very first question is showing bias.....by the way what cost $100.00 in food in my basket is now $185.00! Even at a $20.00 increase is 20% inflation; nothing Biden should be proud of.
4028,&quot;And by the way&quot; - Biden 2024.
4029,"Ever since mr.bìden took possession of the white house  every thing got more expensive,  My pay check is not enough,  Less food on my table,  gasoline price are sky high joe."

4031,Biden memorized these answers. Good for him to be able to get a couple of them
4032,Joe allergic to the truth. Making his face swell instead of nose grow.
4033,"They coming up from South America for better food?  Not just being rude because US better than UK, where I live."
4034,Trump 2020 100%
4035,"This debate makes my stomach hurt. You can’t tell me these two are our only options. It’s not enough to vote for one, just to keep the other out of office."
4036,Trump is smart af Biden can barely talk just bring honest💯
4037,"Should have asked Trump what happened to the money. Like red from donations to build the wall. Also, what happened to his promise of Mexico building the wall. Finally ask him how much money he spent on sponsoring the caravans from Latin America jut to make a point about immigrants."
4038,These are our choices for the president? What a joke
4039,I’d like to know when are they gonna step borrowing money from China and giving our money to foreign nations ?<br>I’d like to know why they don’t move to rerun the money that was taken from social security and ensure that citizens keep their money from ever being touched again?
4040,Voting for Biden is voting for WWW3 and someone who continues to destroy the traditional family by advancing Antichrist genders and marriages that will result in the US no longer existing.
4041,why is biden looks like he is lost and out of place?
4042,"40% reduction in illegal border entry. Can someone fact check this, please."
4043,The real loser of this debate: Americans
4044,What&#39;s the time stamp of the fart on CNN&#39;s feed?
4045,Giving Biden minutes to respond to direct attacks but not Trump. OKAY CNN
4046,My brother can’t get compensation for his health problems due to agent orange exposure.  I’m wondering who all is?
4047,If you can&#39;t see Biden is not well then please don&#39;t vote again.
4048,Is anyone moderating this debate? Trump seems to be jangling on about whatever he wants
4049,Slow Biden made a mistake when he said he had the largest tax cut in history😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

4065,Trump’s idea is good for the country but as trump said from Biden we have been falling down and if trump becomes president the country would be better biden’s words were not that good trumps words spoke proudly he knew everything but Biden was good if the beginning but he has been falling downs like after a year he became president so I am on trump’s side.
4066,I don&#39;t know immigrants crisis in other states but in NYC is a mess.  We need to do something about it.  I am not against immigration but we have to do it in a controlled manner and balanced.  NYC crime has skyrocketed due to immigrants.
4067,the presidency is a very stressful job especially for someone joe biden&#39;s age. he needs to step down he&#39;s been a good president his heart is in the right place. but he is tired the office has took a toll on him. we are in a critical situation in the world and at home. and a sound and stapled leader is needed. and that&#39;s not Donald Trump. if you think you have problems now if Trump wins you can kiss your freedom and peace goodbye. an antichrist always look good in the beginning.
4068,In This debate was Trump and Joe Biden vs Joe Biden. 🥵
4069,"The look on Biden&#39;s face when Trump talks about that girl being murdered. &quot;UH Ohhhh....&quot; HE HAS KILLED SO MANY PEOPLE OPENING OUR BORDERS AND COMMITTED TREASON!!! This is only the beginning. They will breed. This election is not about Biden &amp; his son Beau or Hunter. I am so tired of his drama and catering to his son, the fringe elements in the US and to foreign countries. AMERICA FIRST IN AMERICA! The cocaine in OUR WHITE HOUSE no one knows where it came from?! OK, yeah and I have a bridge to sell you.  And on top of it our country has an unworkable economy now and people are still believing THE BIDEN/HARRIS/JEAN-PIERRE LIES."

4076,"India is the largest democracy they said, what could me more wrong I wonder.<br><br>No right/freedom of speech...you would be jailed if you speak against (even slightly) the PM or other high ranking official. <br><br>Rahul Gandhi deliberately muted during the parliamentary session?<br><br>Democracy is Trump accusing Joe of everything and still walking free. Democracy should never be based on numbers but on how much we uphold the rights of citizens"
4077,Biden needs to be in a nursing home not in the White House
4078,wow never seen worse 🤣🤣😆
4079,Trump 2024 🫡❤️🤍💙
4080,There is a media blackout on Biden&#39;s cluelessness and confusion at the debate. And you wonder why rogue nations are attacking weaker ones since he got into office? And the media wonders why the public distrusts them - it just makes us shake our heads in disbelief how obtuse the media power wielders can be.
4081,Biden needs medical care for his mental condition urgently Biden does not need to be in office w that condition mental condition
4082,Stop blaming &#39;corporate greed&#39;.  What about the government&#39;s greed?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4095,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1129"">18:49</a> this gives me the vibe that joe biden hates babies"
4096,Trump will win ... We don&#39;t need some bumbling Biden.
4097,All politics are liars! They are just  cocking to the public. After they have gotten the position they will not do it.
4098,So tired of trump saying people like him. A debate is to be WHAT a Presdent is going to do for the people of AMERICA

4101,Biden should be under medical care for his dementia cognitive decline should not have been allowed to run for president
4102,Biden says that there were no deaths in the Middle East during his presidency. Did he forget about the drone strike in Jordan 4 months ago
4103,Biden is finished

4105,Biden is a lifetime grifter and figurehead for other hidden agents.
4106,US was safer under President Trump

4109,"Trump is a young Putin, he talks a lot, but in fact he will enrich only his small team, he is like an inexperienced dictator, with him cities will sparkle like diamonds, built by his companies, but the American population will be poor as with all corrupt dictators."

4112,"He called Putin a war criminal, what are you genocide joe?"
4113,So as someone in the middle class...I lived pretty comfortably during Trump&#39;s presidency. I&#39;m currently making significantly more money due to changing jobs during Biden and I&#39;m struggling if that says anything.
4114,Pete Buttigieg for President
4115,"Africans have more millionaires and billionaires than other non-European cultures.  The only Native/Indigenous wealthy people are mixed breeds with just enough native to claim native. Full-blood natives have no status of wealth, Deb Haaland is half dutch.  When a native indigenous is held for show it is a mixed blood. Full bloods and traditionals are kept in poverty.   In this country every business is owned by foreignors, and africans, along with the invasive species europeans."
4116,Trump is such a disgusting liar! I remember when lying was an embarrassment!
4117,TRUMP IS RIGHT! ALL WE HAVE LEFT IS A POWERFUL MILITARY... <br><br>OUR POLITICIANS GIVE BILLIONS AWAY TO OTHER COUNTRIES

4121,Biden is incompetent shows in this debate not capable of making sound decisions not intelligent
4122,"The way biden starts off answering the first question, he presents like he is reading a teleprompter, looks definite like he had the question in advance , but the way he is machine gunning it , he must have those contacts that give him a screen on his eyes , something very dodgy going on by the looks of it."

4133,"I can&#39;t stop laughing, Biden must be pumped up on some serious dope!"
4134,It&#39;s obvious Biden is not all there
4135,Biden is not too bright either and lies about the money he received border crisis shut down production of gas drilling gave Iran a billion dollars released assets for Iran
4136,"Congress, POTUS, and SCOTUS should be paid the average entry level salary of a US citizen and have to live in employee housing while in session. No stock trading for them or their families and income/earnings capped at the top income of their home states average. They need to feel what we feel."

4156,"The two moderators did not catch any of Trump&#39;s countless lies (with readily available fact checks), as was the case in 2020. In doing so, they have encouraged Trump&#39;s conspiracy narratives (which are legally relevant or punishable because they jeopardise American democracy) and his outright lies. In addition, they used the title &quot;President Trump&quot;, which fits in with this extremely negligent to favourable moderation. They didn&#39;t even rebuke Trump&#39;s denials of the American military&#39;s insults (known from TV) as lies. They didn&#39;t even have to do a fact check, because we&#39;ve all seen these unspeakable remarks about fallen American soldiers on TV (he called them &quot;sucker&quot; and &quot;looser&quot;). They should have called him to order in the face of the impudence of lying to the whole world. The judges who are delaying the really important criminal trials against him time and time again are doing exactly the same thing. This type of instinct-less person in charge of the US justice system is sawing at the branch they are sitting on. They are all in the process of destroying US democracy - also by preferring to rant about Biden&#39;s fatigue as a criterion for his inability to fulfil the office of president for another 4 years (you can also see this in the democratically orientated sections of the press = they don&#39;t know what they are doing). They only seem to want to judge Trump&#39;s physical fitness as a criterion - not his degree of stupidity (both political and cognitive), which jeopardises EVERY STATE. To whom does the well-known dictum apply as much as to Trump: He is undoubtedly dumber and more stupid than the police allow ... The criminal nature of this kind of stupidity has also been notoriously recognised by the courts, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t be facing all these lawsuits! But somehow those responsible always seem to want to blame their responsibility on the next instance - apparently until Trump is re-elected as president (as the highest instance), who can then, as we all know, pardon himself ..."
4157,NO PRESIDENT CAN HELP BLACK PEOPLE MORE THAN BLACK PEOPLE CAN... BLACKS IN AMERICA 🇺🇸  GOT TO START LOVING AND APPRECIATING THIER OWN COMMUNITIES FIRST BEFORE THE POLITICIANS OR STATE CAN DO ANYTHING
4158,"If THEY are able to steal this election from us AGAIN, we&#39;re done!!"

4162,biden continues to call trump names😂 how is someone so old acting so childish
4163,How about a 10.000 dollar hand out for any race that would love to purchase a home.
4164,I live in Poland and I&#39;m terrified because the elections are coming and the security of my country also depends on it.
4165,"presenters talking to us as though we are children, twilight zone lackys lol"
4166,The ignorance of Trump is astounding.
4167,The president Joe Biden is awful. He is too old. He’s very bad president. We need a new leader.
4168,Op# both re:watch &amp; look to improve nx. Match😃
4169,Go Trump!!!
4170,The world is leaderless. One will come with all the fix&#39;s out of nowhere.
4171,Someone gave joe an adderall
4172,Why does POTIS lie so much??
4173,This is sad to watch! Look who is USA&#39;s president. Biden need to  be at home and taking care of himself. He will be happy when Trump win 2024.
4174,"If you think quality of life is better today than it was before covid you are lying to yourself and everyone you love and care about. I got a pay raise during trump, then got a better job, my money went so much further, and I wasn’t having to work like a dog to comfortable and give my family everything they need. It’s getting worse and worse. Crime and drug use is out of control and homelessness and immigration is insane. Housing is sparse and unattainable. There’s nothing I can think of that’s better today and I didn’t even mention the global conflicts happening because they know know we are weak right now!"
4175,Biden can’t end a sentence without a lie
4176,"It’s not up to the president on how many black people are in jail or prison. You go to jail/prison based on the crime you do. Skin color has nothing to do with that.<br><br>ALSO, giving ONLY black families a $10,000 tax credit toward buying their first home.. white people are struggling too! Why is this about color? White people could argue how racist that is. ALL Americans are struggling, not just a certain color. Get a life Joe. Be so fr. 🙄"
4177,Stop helping Ukraine. <br>That is not our business. <br>Let them fight their own war. <br>Take care of our economy don’t destroy it.
4178,Winning in Afghanistan * fixed it for ya joey
4179,Neither of these two should even be running. They’re both too old and are continuing the divide in this country. The way they throw cheap shots at each other is just embarrassing for our country. This is not reality tv. Ridiculous.
4180,BIDEN MADE  TRUMP  YOUNG .
4181,I can hear Biden perfectly fine and he is definitely answering these questions yall are choosing not to hear him because it&#39;s a gag to make fun of the elderly
4182,"Time to do a write in, who&#39;s with me?"
4183,Make America Great Again
4184,"Biden isn’t looking good, old man needs to retire."
4185,I hope trump wins
4186,"Best way to see what’s been done for veterans under Biden … ASK A HOMELESS VETERAN,"
4187,"The best military?  No one will mess with us?  Lessee, there&#39;s Ukraine where Russia is threatening nukes, in fact is talking about trying to take Alaska back.  The Chinese waging of cyber and economic warfare on the US has escalated to the point where invasion of Taiwan now looks likely.  The withdrawal from Afghanistan was the most disgraceful example of military retreat since the evacuation of Saigon in &#39;75.  A traitor and mutineer not only continued to serve in the Joint Chiefs after the discovery of his crimes, but has since retired with full benefits, and is celebrated.  Yaaah...our woke indoctrinated military is the best in the world."

His wife as well. He gets NOTHING from his time in the service. Everything he has he has from his own two hands. No benefits. NOTHING.

4191,Trump for 4 more years of America Great Again <br>🇺🇸🇺🇸🇸🇻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇸🇻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇸🇻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇸🇻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇸🇻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇸🇻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇸🇻🇺🇸
4192,The most informative part about this debate were the ads about Korn going on tour. Smh..
4193,"Middle schoolers pointing fingers, he did that, but he did this. I agree with one of the other comments, if you&#39;ve never seen an empire fall, you&#39;re wathing it"
4194,The respect was lost with Trump for other countries.
4195,im new to politics.  i never voted.   always though it was a sham. after watching this presidential debate  - i got so embarrassed by this he said she said finger pointing bs!  i can&#39;t believe we put our trust into clowns like these two.  one is not better than the other.   Shame and embarrassment!!!! I can&#39;t believe entire world is going to watch this.
4196,"We would rather have our own babies to raise and take care of other than people coming across the border where we have no idea who they are, where they come from, and whether or not they came out of prisons and mental institutions. We don’t know whether our babies will be killed or not. Nothing is transparent!"
4197,I don’t think Biden know what monetary policy is and also he mentions hitler at some point which was 10000000% irrelevant to anything
4198,"Roe v Wade didn’t go away. It was turned over to the states.  It a woman doesn’t agree with the state laws in her state, go to a different state and have an abortion. Or, hey, use birth control, then she won’t find herself in the situation of having an unwanted pregnancy.<br>Trump said he wanted the PEOPLE living in each state to help create the law in their own state concerning abortion. <br>Roe v Wade had many unethical, unwanted guidelines. Late-term abortions is unethical <del>period</del> especially when a woman will know if anything is medically wrong with the child by the first trimester. If a woman waits until the third trimester to abort, she’s doing it for the wrong reasons. At that point, HAVE THE BABY AND PUT THE CHILD UP FOR ADOPTION.<br>The abort-any-time-you-feel-like-it is unacceptable."
4199,Insulin injection $15? Since when pal?😂

4205,"I want to vote against Donald Trump because I do not trust him, but the Democrats are proving how out of touch they really are if they don&#39;t understand that Biden is not fit for the world stage and everyone has had the last 4 years to watch his decline."
4206,Go Kennedy!
4207,They make it sound like a game show
4208,You are not admired any longer.
4209,"Someone get Mr. Biden a cup of coffee, perhaps a Red Bull, or just a pillow.<br>Can anybody truly believe what the acting President is saying ?<br>People , do your homework."

4212,Biden holding a pen...the only thing he can write with that is sign his name on the worst policies😂
4213,Look at the ties Trump a blood and Biden a crip😂
4214,"Im sorry, President Biden, but a twenty dollar increase on groceries is not true. Food, gas, everything is through the roof."
4215,We should not have to keep pressing the rewind button just to clearrly hear and understand what  our own President is saying!!!!
4216,I believe this is the Biden actor wearing a mask. Although there were obvious senior moments he speaks much more fluently than the real Biden.
4217,"Everyone should vote for the Independent candidate because, these guys are a joke and old!"
4218,Trump (speaks facts with evidence). Biden: “everything he said was lie!!”

4224,"Is Biden just listing his own rap sheet, what a political stooge. He is late for tapioca and his nap."
4225,"No military personal died abroad under Biden? That’s a kick in the teeth to all losing maimed and killed in his ridiculously botched exit from Afghanistan, but we already knew he doesn’t care about the military or protectors of the nation. Trying to shake that one veteran’s hand when it was obvious he no longer had one was painful to watch, not even apologising. Just on to talking about himself. Horrid man."
4226,"Lies, lies and more lies"
4227,Trump wants to gut social security
4228,We need subtitles for zombie Biden.
4229,"I love all these new things Biden has in store. Cutting costs on black childcare, giving black people free money to buy houses, giving them money back for their student loans. Might as well say hey whitey get ready to pay the blacks. What an absolute joke"
4230,There won&#39;t be another debate Biden will be sleeping
4231,"That was painful to watch. Half completely unintelligible, the other half empty buzz words and smears - on both sides"
4232,"REMEMBER, Trump is a BUSINESSMAN. Financial actions that he suggests and supports WILL work over time. <br>“Strengthening” child care, health care, etc. costs more money to the folks NOT currently using it. WE DON’T WANT THAT.<br>We the People are p!$$ed 0ff. We are tired. We are done with the B$."
4233,Biden mentioning hitler is crazy when no one was talking about hitler
4234,"Biden was the same only hosrt voice and taken back by Trump barage of misinformstion and support for Nazie and Puting. He was very concise, clear, conscious and Frank. He is very different than Trump who is a promoter with false facts and 34 count of feloney conviction trying to get raise from people. Biden said exackly what needed to be said and was focused. He noumorated his facts that support his conclusion, unlike Trump who shoots in every direction with fase informtion. I thinck Biden was more surprise by Trump ignorent and you observed his surprised expression."
4235,In order to be middle class in this economy in california we gotta be making 200k Biden has eliminated the middle class in most of the country

4241,“ every time Zelinski comes to America. He walks away with $60 billion.” _ Donald Trump.
4242,Believe he has.
4243,These journalists could not disguise that they had a preferred candidate!  But he and the party didn&#39;t know how to govern and they&#39;re going to get out!  Trump is the best!
4244,Trump is in a great shape and it definitely be the President on November 5th
4245,This was a slaughter. Biden has gotten VERY difficult to listen to.
4246,OH scholars support it so they speak for the majority of America? Give me a break
4247,Can&#39;t wait for Saturday Night Live.
4248,"Please. Voting is not enough. You must bring at least ten people with you. We need to get Trump back in office and the only way to do that is to vote like we are 25 points behind. Get people registered, give them rides, and realize that you are the only person who can save our country."
4249,"Watched the whole debate, they edited this clip!!!!!!"
4250,Where he&#39;s been.????
4251,Get that lunar tick<br>biden off🤪🤤

4253,We all like a nice fence around our house with a awesome gates
4254,everything sleepy joe says is BS this POTUS did nothing but engage warfare leading us to WW3 in the name of Ukraine proxy war with NATO
4255,Trump is right. If he would have done his job then t here wouldn’t be any COVID deaths under Biden . If trump did his job Tünchers wouldn’t have been any
4256,There definitely should be an age limit at ALL levels of the government. Where are our educated millennials at?!
4257,They let trump talk more and let Biden talk less because they don’t want  Biden to look like a fool and because trump has a big mouth they trying to make him look like a fool. But I rather have a president who sticks up for America and wants America strong again
4258,Give the world a break
4259,If we sold all the equipment we left in Afghanistan we could have housed millions of homeless vets. Or fed millions of malnurished children. Or yanno just been able to not have to print more money and cost more taxpayer dollars. Disgraceful
4260,Trump never looked so good my president today tomorrow and forever
4261,This debate I have to say was better than the Hilary vs Trump debate and I&#39;m  impressed with Trump he&#39;s actually saying whats really going on that&#39;s wrong in our country 🎯💯

4271,"Great, the worst news station of all CNN"
4272,"I didn&#39;t think Trump could lose in 2020. I was proven wrong and learned a valuable lesson about the power of propaganda, ideological bubbles and elitism. So while I enjoy reading all the funny comments, just remember... None of it matters, no matter how secure you feel, if you don&#39;t actually go out and vote. Let&#39;s not get complacent."
4273,I stand with Texas!
4274,"In Simple: Yes, MAGA Trumpism is corruption Central and Donald J. Trump (45) is this Parties immoral commander in con. Trump’s (DJT-45) quest of win through dark works of deception, conspiratorial malice of divine-scripture, and diversly opposed to equal Justic.

4316,"Maryland mayor was ready to send help, they denied him."
4317,Man… Trump can’t quite lying 😂 as usual. This mfker will destroy the country like when he was the worst president in the American history. Remember other country ban Americans to enter their countries? So many of who worked for Trump turned on him in court.
4318,Biden is so full of crap no wonder he soils himself
4319,World peace??? Aren’t there wars going on??? That WE fund?!!
4320,"This so-called debate exposed Biden for the gross incompetence he is.  As we speak illegals, from all walks of life, are waltzing into our country.  The Venezuelans, who are among the worst, have special protections and citizenship rights."
4321,826470565238OPC:[DT: We(USA) are very close to WWIII]
4322,"Biden held his own. Biden quoted policy and what has been accomplished under his administration. Trump sounded like a bully, throwing insults, repeating all his old lies and personal aggravations and many delusional belief without proof of anything. Biden has a cold. Trump has a diseased heart and mind."
4323,"How many times did Biden say “the idea”? <br><br>Also, something I really dislike about politicians is they never really answer the questions. They’re just trying to prove who’s best and why their opponent sucks. <br><br>How about some solutions to actual problems?"

4337,They should&#39;ve had a time clock playing &amp; recorded.
4338,I don’t vote. I personally think it’s all fake . Reason I think it’s all fake is because no hard questions are asked and no one is exposing each other for their deep issues. I’ve had better arguments on Xbox live parties.
4339,"Yes joe, as one of the &quot;very wealthy&quot; you should pay more for the rest of us. Politicians should absolutely pay more."
4340,Why they keep calling him president?
4341,I wonder if they had the questions prior to the debate.I also wonder what is being said into Biden’s right ear piece.
4342,Biden&#39;s statements are 99.9% FLAT OUT LIES. WOW. It&#39;s truly mind-boggling that there are people out there who fall for his UTTER CRAP...
4343,He absolutely 💯! Go TRUMP

4345,"This whole thing looks scripted. It looks like both knew what the other person was going to say. Otherwise how would either one&#39;s teleprompter be correct? Just hollywood everyone, nothing to see here. Also Trump&#39;s hair has a slight green screen hue to it and nothing looks right with either one of them."

4370,Wow Biden was fact check is a liar.. and this was by CNN lol 🎉😂
4371,"Presidential debates are won and lost based on what a candidate needs to do. candidate. <br><br>Biden needed to prove he was strong, fit, and sharp. But all he did was prove that the corporate media have been lying to us about his fitness for last four years (but we already knew that) that media just can’t lie about it anymore.<br><br>What was also confirm from the debate and was much talk around the Country is clear Biden is not running the Country especially day to day!  <br><br>We can’t wait until Nov election it’s 25th Amendment time."

Trump in 2024 is the same back when he was first in office, nothing has changed and nothing will in this country, him saying our Economy was Perfect Under him, perfect??? Dude overexaggerates everything he says, Biden lost this debate because he cant debate properly at in his condition, this was a spanking. But it wouldve been better if RFK JR was there as well, hes a candidate, Trump didnt want RFK JR to debate with them because it would hurt Trumps debate views, RFK JR has a lot more incite in this country and better views  that Trump knew would hurt his claim and presidency"

4414,Who was Biden waving at? There is not an audience!!!
4415,so… can we fight for a new system now 😭
4416,Kennedy was supposed to be on there
4417,Biden aint working at all he aint doin nothin economy is bad becuase u keep sending money for war between russia and ukraine and letting them go to war
4418,The fact that we are having a conversation particularly geared toward economic or any other opportunity for blacks is a conversation that we need to be having. Somebody somewhere seems to still be pushing the idea that we should remain separate and unequal.
4419,Why are referring Trump as President. He’s not a current president.
4420,"Obama was responsible for the Choice veteran programs,  not Trump."
4421,President Trump is the best ❤
4422,This is sad not funny.
4423,More border patrol and more sidemoffers sounds like a great idea! Except that B&#39;s administration fought Texas on putting up a fence. Oh and sidemoffers isn&#39;t a thing.
4424,this whole debate just makes all of america look bad. get these bafoons off of any platform😢
4425,I legit think Biden was asleep in between questions 😂.

4433,Trump should go after his dead son
4434,"Biden batting his eyes, &amp; Stuttering his Words, bc hes chocking to get those Lies 🗣Out. Get ur Lies together!"
4435,This wasted time I’ll never get back…
4436,January 6 was the people making a point
4437,Next move.<br>President Trump will go to jail.
4438,Does Masa Biden have a form of pneumonia?
4439,Provide weapons and money for other countries but not housing for homeless in your own country
4440,I like how the moderator call them both as &quot;president&quot;
4441,"😂😂😂😂And how many times, changes in courts, judges, and lawyers did it take for the left to get him convicted???"
4442,"How are these two geriatrics the best the US can produce for presidency? I mean, clearly they aren&#39;t the best, but they&#39;re somehow the candidates??? Over 330 million people in the country, and these are the two running for leadership?"
4443,"Biden, Ur a whole Lie... Everything  u Put on T, is really ALL U!"
4444,"So a cousin of mine works for the FAA for about 10 years now. Prior to that he was in the USAF for 16 years and forced to leave so they didnt have to pay his retirement. And he was highly rated so it wasnt a performance thing. He recently re-located to Colorado to fill a hard to fill job with the FAA because of the travel while taking a pay cut. The kicker... they would not even help pay for his relocation so he paid for it all. Tell me how someone that has done nothing but serve the country gets nothing taking a hard to fill government job, takes a pay cut, yet we give thousands of dollars and housing and other things to illegal immigrants. Its really a shame"
4445,No terrorist  should get through

4449,Joe Biden is lost in his own head.  there&#39;s no way he won 2020. He was installed and is told what to do from TDS anti-American woke garbage people with big noses.
4450,Trump is such a bully.
4451,"If this doesn&#39;t get Cornel West a victory, nothing will."
4452,Anybody ever hear of the year of the SUN!!!????  It’s 2024-2025
4453,If you vote for Biden reply with B<br>If you vote for Trump reply with T
4454,If I was Russia I would invade immediately
4455,The truth here is bide created nothing. I got called back to work after the pandemic. That was already my job. So what new jobs did Biden create? I could afford food under trump not under Biden. Biden is for Ukraine not the united states
4456,CORPORATE GREED??? 😂 YOU MEAN ??? HOW YOU GAVE ZELENSKY LOANS??? MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS
4457,"First Lady&#39;s, etc."
4458,"I had money when President Trump was in office. Food was affordable, gas was affordable,  housing was affordable everything was better. Trump 2024 !!!!"
4459,Imperial Wizard vs Grand Dragon 😂

4470,There will be a new candidate in place of Joe before the election. Watch!
4471,"Lord, have mercy on President Biden. Restoration for good health have your way, Lord JESUS."

4483,Biden i came from….blah bah blah
4484,Oh my gosh! We are in trouble as a nation..
4485,Dementia with a splash of deer in the headlights!
4486,"I don&#39;t care what you did, what are you going to do?"
4487,"you have got to be kidding me, all of that writing."
4488,"Wow, Biden looks and sounds like he needs to step  down from office.  Trump is way more clear in his speaking and way more lucid.  It is hard to see Biden in this state."
4489,Go for president who we Trust!!!!!
4490,Biden saying “you are a child” to Trump lives in my head rent free
4491,"More CLEMENCY happened under Ts Administration, than evrrr before! Biden, Ppl are still in Jail  for Crimes they didn&#39;t Commit, &amp; Why!!??? 🤔"

4494,"The insanity of the opinion of how things are and how we got here is just so warped.<br>At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=76"">1:16</a> Bidens account of how the rest of the world sees America - no sense of reality.<br>Biden appeared to have a right ear piece in to receive prompts- this is elder abuse on BOTH parts. We need younger, better, capable. We need statesmen and all over the world. WW III is not an acceptable out for the mistakes made. So very sad for all those dead and dying in unnecessary wars. 😢"
4495,This whole debate is a joke
4496,I&#39;m ready for some new vibrant candidates

4499,Biden is a liar! 😡😠😡😠
4500,"What I learned today from Biden... was &quot;The IDEA&quot;. I lost count. Too many ideas, &quot;0&quot; action"
4501,No studio audience. I guess they didnt want any cheering or reactions to influence the people at home
4502,Why does Biden think corporations own the housing market? He said it twice before the 1hr mark as he stumbled through answers about the economy and black voters.
4503,Joe is out of his mind and everyone seeing it.This is elderly abuse
4504,"Dems looking bad, trump 1-0, dems will lose this election, defeat is inevitable"
4505,All trump does is blame blame blame over the same thing over and over again is he on a tape recorder or are they just playing the blame game nothing that they are saying makes any sense  this debate is ridiculous
4506,"I&#39;m not a fan of either one of these guys, but the way Trump evades the questions is unreal.  It&#39;s as if he think people are really that stupid! I would never vote for Sgt.  Bone spurs. Disrespect dead and maimed soldiers, make fun of a disable reporter, don&#39;t want to pay those who work for him. Someone so out of touch, that he thinks you need to show I. D.  in order to buy bread. Maga=Make Attorneys get Attorneys. Gas prices were low under Trump because no one was driving due to the pandemic. When there&#39;s no demand, prices are low. Simple economics.  He&#39;s a joke and a con man.  Jan. 6th was a disaster and he instigated it. He talks alot within saying anything,"
4507,"I think they should take it to the octagon <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23danawhite"">#danawhite</a><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ufc"">#ufc</a>"

4511,I wonder America has lost it? Retire Biden decisions you&#39;re making shows in this interview 🙄 sad
4512,Yikes! That Biden is ready for a nursing home. He can&#39;t run this country.
4513,"Heres an IDEA Joe, youre a liar. The economy was doing good. Unemployment for black americans were at the all time low. Everhthing they state as a fact he turns around and says no, no, thats not true. Hes senile."
4514,"When Biden said they would fix medical care, My first thought was: He should fix his Medical Care. He should be in a hospital, I feel bad for him. MAGA."
4515,Cant afford rent
4516,51 years of roe v wade doesnt make it good. The NFA and the GCA and Hughes amendment all have been around for years. Doesnt make them any less unlawful  or unconstitutional. 😂
4517,Biden just got flippin waxed good god
4518,And for the people talking about the immigrants getting thousands for food and living U totally agree. Our veterans are in the streets while immigrants are in 5 star hotels
4519,"Hello, I am Azerbaijani, of Kavkaz origin, I support Ukraine. Ukraine will win and I love Joe Biden. He is a good and respected president. Joe Biden. Everyone thinks that Joe Biden is old and that he starts wars, this is wrong. Russia Putin is dictator, his aim is to break up democratic states. American citizens should know that this vote will be for dictator Putin, Trump is a puppet. Joe Biden&#39;s departure will be a great disappointment for all countries that want to get rid of Putin and the Russians. Please think carefully, Joe Biden should not go.

4528,Trump 2024
4529,"First statement. Groceries= 100 dollars before, and now 120.00. Wrong!  In most states it is 150.00 plus. They need to fact check their numbers! Secondly, why does Biden keep looking down at his desk? What is he reading? His eyes are following something on his desk in front of him. Trump never looks down, but Biden always looks down. Thirty three minutes, and nine seconds into the debate, Biden is seen picking up a notebook and turning the page, although he has not been seen writing a single word during the debate. What is going on?"
4530,Stop lying!!!! Joe Biden all you do is lie and steal from us and not take care of American citizens all of our heart earned tax dollars a way to other countries why answer the question why why why why are you not taking care of your own backyard
4531,"I am not God, the Lord, etc. I just believe in the Lord, that is true and is not understood. because it is very hard. It is a hard love in righteousness."
4532,Child care was more affordable when did Donald Trump win the cost of living was around 30% lower. How much did Child Care go up under Joe Biden let&#39;s get this stuff straight
4533,"Real, successful person vs Programmed, disabled embezzler"
4534,United States American citizens we the people are ashamed of you Joe Biden get out of our White House
4535,How are these the best two candidates that we can find? It&#39;s the same exact thing I said in 2020.

4541,"That&#39;s absolutely right.  I&#39;m a veteran and I have zero respect for Biden.  I&#39;m not a big fan of Trump, either.  But certainly Biden, a draft dodger just like Trump and Clinton, has no interest in veterans.  Draftb dodger m#<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23f"">#f</a>#<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rr"">#rr</a>."

4543,I seen something other than what Biden
4544,Why do you use some that money that money you get from China Joe.
4545,"When the question was asked on the majority of Black ppl are incarcerated ( in Criminal Justice system), what are you going to do about it? NO ANSWER from TRUMP or BIDEN!!  WHY??"
4546,Joe needs to pack his bags and get off the White House him and the entire administration
4547,"The fact these two are our primary choices is why I’m voting for the RFK. The fact that these two are so devices, and for lack of a better word, “toxic,” to our union only goes to show the failures that are inherit in a two party system. We must send a clear message, that if the two big parties in politics can’t not give us a decent candidate then we the people will vote for the third option."
4548,"Wow, this is just to sad for words. I feel like I&#39;m coming out of a deep sleep and don&#39;t know where I am listening to Biden."
4549,I feel like Trump’s ending statement was pretty strong other than that both of them did terrible
4550,Where are all the Biden voters now?🤭🤣

4559,Thx God and my father Satan will decide - E 🔥
4560,They have to cut Trump off because hes making too much sense....then they have to cut Biden off to save him 🤣
4561,I hope they get to doing some actual fact-checking on everything till Biden said and make sure the report on it goes out to the public telling the absolute truth
4562,"This shows the weakness of &quot;Freedom of Democracy&quot; where it allows the worst and problematic US President candidates, who is criminal and the other has mental health  problems due to his age and where both should retire and stay at home for watering,  flowers...<br>and.. <br>The people have no choice but to choose one of them...<br>$@#&quot;?!="
4563,Vote Jill Stein!!!! Do not get these clowns in!!!!
4564,They had Biden so wound up his eyes almost popped out of his head a few times.
4565,Joe did you see svastikas in Ukraine? Shame of you! America wake up. You deserve better than this senile grandpa!
4566,Trudeau is also taking baby boomers retirement money. They saved at least 45 years for retirement
4567,Please bring America back!
4568,In the middle east  And people are dying in ukraine  you are  responsible America will experience  a disaster  this is  inevitable
4569,"Because trump doesn&#39;t pay taxes, he doesn&#39;t realize that most people already pay at least a 1/4 of there income in taxes, and could not pay 125% of their income"
4570,All Joe did was lie and per usual the news media call Trump the liar.... from Jill on down to cnn and others knew what we have known about Joe.... they have lied about Trump for years and will continue to do so all while telling you don&#39;t believe what your lying eyes saw last night.  You deserve what you get if you keep voting these same liars into office....we do not deserve it.
4571,Those historians who say Trump is the worst President ever are the most stupid people ever.
4572,"Biden stated all 3 of these:<br>1. We created 15,000 new jobs<br>2. We have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs<br>3. We added 15 million new jobs<br><br>Excuse me?"
4573,"What about first time white home buyer. What about white people student loans. How about we treat Americans equal and stop dividing us by color. We bleed the same, red, white, and blue. If you don&#39;t the leave the country"
4574,Biden lied and lied.<br>Biden said the border patrol endorsed him which was a flat out lie.<br>Guess Biden forgets about the 13 American that were killed in his disastrous Afghanistan exit.
4575,Biden gave billions to Hamas
4576,"LoL a bag of food 100 to 120 sence he bacame president hahahaha i wish, i have 4 kids and i spend more in food then anyting else, better said is, 100 to 300"
4577,I cannot believe Biden used Afghanistan as a point of pride multiple times. The way we pulled out should be his greatest shame as a president.
4578,"The scholars that voted 🗳️ Trump as the worst President Ever are all Washington Plants 🌱 . That’s the truth so it’s bullsh*t, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE BEST PRESIDENT EVER."
4579,我就想知道白灯有没有变傻😂
4580,"Biden: Seven billion Americans are alive today because I opened the mushroom castle, he watered the garden of pooffdoll draple stop it!<br>Trump: …<br>Biden: See he has no answers for kettle ball sandwiches!"
4581,Bidens brain is like Google predictive text...you never know whats going to come out or if it will even be coherent. I wouldn&#39;t trust him to drive a car down a one way street.
4582,We should settle this by competing on Apex
4583,Biden needs to work on his poker face... Trump is all over him!
4584,"Biden looks ill in health. If he is having chronic issues, he shouldn&#39;t be allowed to participate."
4585,"So, if the courts lied, like you do you think it makes it right??  Biden you make me angry.  I will be glad when The Lord stops you."
4586,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=3480"">58:00</a> climate change is another fallacy to try to brainwash Americans into a life of fear."
4587,JB looks like a dead body talking. Can&#39;t believe America had this NWO clown sitting in the president&#39;s chair.
4588,Pres. Trump your the Best.
4589,When is their real debat??
4590,"Why is it most people can&#39;t even understand what Obiden is even saying the man is crazy and doesn&#39;t even ever need to be a president of nothing I&#39;m begging the American people to see through Obidens trap of crap before nobody can fix what&#39;s coming up.. <br><br>And the man can&#39;t even talk right and everybody talks about Trump losing his temper well Obiden does the same thing it&#39;s just tongue tied and never finished all the time from the time he took office and sat down in the presidency seat that&#39;s when it all started with Obiden (truth) so please people Obiden is only there as a face and he can&#39;t hardly even do that right, he&#39;s a puppet on the strings of a president before him .. <br><br>Now the way Trump has acted in the past at times is not right either but he had and has America&#39;s best at heart all the time but was ridiculed by others and also by Obiden and I apologize by saying OBiden to anyone I just believe Obama is the puppet Master just my opinion and also by Hillary Clinton and if this keeps up this world will be a communist country Biden needs to step aside and see his wrongs.!!!!!!!. He needs to take the stick from his own I before taking the splinter from someone else&#39;s I and I&#39;m not trying to quote from the Bible I&#39;m just telling it like it is even though the Bible says something similar"
4591,Trump 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲💪💪
4592,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1239"">20:39</a> 😂"
4593,Brawno!
4594,"This is ridiculous, they&#39;re both old clowns making us the laughingstock of the world. When will we get an actual president?"
4595,"Biden, go Sit down &amp; BIDE ur time! 😂 bc come Jan 6, 25, T will be back Runin thangs... 😂😂"
4596,He lied again. I paid twice the amount of taxes in 2024. Making the same amount of money. Biden is a liar.
4597,Has anyone ever seen the documentary about the America called Idiocracy?
4598,"Now here&#39;s the questions I really want asked. <br>Who out of the presidential election is going to help the stock market. <br>What policies are going to be put in place to help inflation for both the rich and the poor. <br>I highly think the minimum wage should be lowered back down because the cost of living is ridiculous both adults elderly and young adults are struggling just to make a living. <br>Will there be more job opportunities, what will be put in place that will encourage someone to hire the amount of workers needed instead of cutting costs. <br>And finally what is going to be done about the rapidly declining education system. <br>Economy, education, work those are the three things that make a society. That&#39;s what the people care about getting fixed that affect their daily lives"
4599,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=3120"">52:00</a> inflation isn&#39;t a racial issue, it is an everyone issue. The problem is Biden&#39;s move to murder our economy with his mandates and allowed our potential to be energy independent to get kicked to the curb. What Biden doesn&#39;t realize and most president&#39;s don&#39;t realize is energy drives everything. Energy dictates all elements of our lives. With Trump fuel cost was low, therefore energy cost was low, therefore inflation was low. Covid disrupted our lives and that was an inside job as well. The Democrats little eugenicist known as Anthony Fauci was tasked with killing and maiming as many people as possible and try to destroy Trump all in one swoop. They almost got away with it. Democrat politicians are vile and evil people."
4600,Why would we need to pay more taxes whether the people or companies if yall making poor decisions with the money yall are getting?? With the mics muted Biden looks terrible compared to Trump
4601,Climate is nothing but a BS
4602,"Oh boy, the difference in Bidens mental acuity between this debate, and the one 4 years ago is stark. What is he gonna look/sound like 4 years from now? Dems, please give us a different candidate 🙏🏼"
4603,Nothing Biden can say is true. Biden actions speaks for itself
4604,These Democratic media seem to promote more murder of not only unborn; but also newborns! 😠😡😠😒🤨
4605,The safety in this country is the worst in history
4606,That was funny Joe Biden Old-Timers man don&#39;t even know what to say
4607,"This is the leader that democrats support, pathetic 😂 the border patrol did not support biden by the way 😂"
4608,Biden was a great president. he created thousands of millions of jobs. That&#39;s why the border had to be opened. Now you need thousands of millions of people to fill those jobs. It&#39;s all very sensible.
4609,Trump claims every good thing didn’t go directly into answering questions he didn’t have any promise on all questions he just desperately wanted to get into office
4610,Homer Simpson for President!!!
4611,"Trump, the &quot;Hyperbolic Huckster&quot; missed his calling in life:  as the winner of the most distasteful used car salesman award known to man."
4612,Why is our veterans still living in the streets every veteran i know are Trump supporters
4613,"Oh please, Biden has never upheld our Constitution,  biden has spit on it and Americans."
4614,Either way trump shouldn’t be considered a candidate due to actual charges he has on him
4615,Biden needs to go to an old folks home
4616,"Biden was a mess, trump was basically exaggerating  and talking  in nonspecifics"
4617,Moderator&#39;s performance was better than anticipated.  Biden was the laughing stock of the WORLD!
4618,This sounds like every president&#39;s debate ever done. Don&#39;t they have anything nice to say. 😂
4619,I wouldn&#39;t vote for either of them.
4620,Trump claims every good thing didn’t go directly into answering questions he didn’t have any promise on all questions he just desperately wanted to get into office
4621,"No, that&#39;s not their land.  That land belongs to Israel,  it was given by God."
4622,"I actually feel bad for Biden, poor guy just needs to step down......and Trumps lies are pathetic, he doesn&#39;t need to lie, stick to the truth and he would win easily."
4623,"Why is it that both of them have had the best numbers in history on every single subject?😂 if Biden is gonna bring roe vs wade back, why wait till reelection? Why didn&#39;t he last 4 yrs? Don&#39;t make promises you can&#39;t fulfill. Smh."
4624,Biden said 500 billon dollars over 10 years from taxing the rich will wipe out the debt. How much is the national debt again?
4625,Knowing one of these two will be leading a country for the next four years is a terrifying prospect
4626,Turn on Closed captions and enjoy the mess that comes when jb speaks haha
4627,"The Republicans have been trying to destroy social security, medicare and the middle class for years."
4628,Biden came off as too incoherent and struggling to appear relevant.
4629,"If u dont stop, 51 years ago is NOT NOW... ur Craz Biden."
4630,"Being the incorrigible sociopath he is, Trump can easily rattle off his lies so effortlessly without a hitch."
4631,"Hunter Biden , Jim Biden and Joe and Jill should be locked up!"
4632,If Biden wanted to restore abortions then why didn’t he do it during his four term?
4633,"It would be so much easier to feel sympathy for Biden if he wasn&#39;t such a nasty egomaniac, either oblivious to the damage of his policies or piggishly contemptuous to those complaining about it. Trump&#39;s massive ego has never prevented him from acknowledging the  voices of grassroots Americans. Biden&#39;s venomous arrogance reminds me of the jerk John McCain."
4634,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=1200"">20:00</a> The border patrol DOES NOT ENDORSE BIDEN! Where’s Maury with the lie detector test. 😂"
4635,Everything want up since Joe biden&#39;s been in office even gas we was paying over almost $5 a gallon Donald Trump we was paying a 1$  something
4636,Ones lying the other is dying
4637,Israel has every right to defend their country against these interlopers.  You need to back Israel and stop blocking them.  You never organized anything except pooping in your pants.
4638,R.F.KENNEDY Jr.<br>The only choice  !!!
4639,Why is Biden mumbling during this entire debate? Is he really just bullshitting and lying through this entire debate thinking people are buying in to support him?
4640,I would love to see the offical transcript of this....
4641,But guys Joe Biden put a fair share with people that have billion dollars
4642,i dont want trump but Biden is too old
4643,By far trump has so much more energy and confidence than Biden
4644,"they both looked bad, Biden look so weak physically and he had a harder time getting out what he wanted yes I know about his speech impediment.<br>Trump really could not answer a more than half of the question he was given. Trump did what he usual does evade, defect, plays the victim, and blame other for his mistakes. A good leader know how to take accountability for his actions."
4645,please change biden for someone else. he cant even get a sentence without thinking a long time
4646,"The way I see it, if this nit head; Biden, wants to give away money.  Give it to the underpaid military.  Oh shut up biden, you sound as ignorant as you are."
4647,Team trump
4648,"I pity the Americans, your choices are the definition of &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;, either you get an old criminal with literal fanatic followers or a senile old man getting worse by the day. The American people need to make a third party, it is the only possible solution."
4649,The idea. The idea. The fact of the matter is. Pathetic!!!
4650,Trump lies about everything on his mouth he doesn’t answer the questions about  January 6th riots the Capital so President Bidden is right about Democracy will destroy and looks Trump teams are taking Russia sides they don’t care about innocent people like Ukraine
4651,I didn&#39;t think Joe Biden sounded like he had a cold 😂😂😂
4652,"Interesting how she purposely says, &#39;Former and Past President Trump.&#39;  Who do you think she likes?"
4653,They never mentioned California
4654,"Wait, so now Trump is finally admitting that covid is real?"
4655,Trumps sounding watered down
4656,Is Binden a Zombie??!!   He sound like that his nasal was being over used cocaine just like Bong Bong Bangag Marcos the addict President
4657,Biden is mentally deficient
4658,"Yes, he paid for Russia to attack Ukraine.   This administration is disgusting.  Many soldiers has died under OBiden."
4659,United states American power ❤❤ confirm
4660,"Sounds like Trump&#39;s different, under the gun? Did they get to him?"
4661,What are black and Hispanic jobs?
4662,Biden the worst president
4663,We need an age limit.
4664,800 new manufacturers jobs all for the illegals he brought to our American land
4665,Biden is such a liar! He lied about everything he said!
4666,America has never before been stuck between the bottle and the label as badly as this!
4667,Sad to see Americans suffer under these two old fools. Ask yourself do you want your children to die under these two?
4668,Biden may had a odd day so what  Mr  Jeffries on the job
4669,"If 62 is the age in which our society agrees that people are physically and mentally too old to be in the workforce anymore, why do we hold our elected officials to a higher standard? These 80-year-old dementia ridden sock puppets are in no way mentally capable of leading this country. If either Russia or China want to invade us, these geesers would be ineffective."
4670,"Biden and his administration are guilty of that 12 YO girl&#39;s loss of life and the torture she went through.  No Trump is not lying.  My husband&#39;s monthly income from his military medical retirement was cut more than half.  You are a looser Biden, you are a jerk."
4671,"Biden had a cold, his voice wasn’t good, too hoarse. It wasn’t the best performance but Donald Lied the whole way through."
4672,"&quot;We have 15 thousand new jobs ... We have 800 thousand new manufacturing jobs.&quot;<br>Good Lord, Biden!  STEP DOWN!!!!!"
4673,"Adding insult to injury, Biden is a clinical liar, when he opens his mouth he lies"
4674,"You have over 400 million people, and this is the best you could provide? Seriously? Neighbors? Come on??? I sincerely love you guys but OMG what an embarrassment."
4675,U haven&#39;t fixed the TAXES Yet Biden... FOOD is Taxed HIGHER than evrrr.
4676,Thanks to Trump this network finally got some views.😂
4677,When the moderators ask a question and Trump rambles on about another  topic   the moderators should stop Trump and redirect him to the question !
4678,Bro this was on my TV for so long the words &quot;FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE&quot; are burned into my screen
4679,"&quot;...no props or notes during the debate...&quot; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=330"">5:30</a> pen, paper &amp; notes?"
4680,"Nahh..CNN is on the same side with biden period, period, period."
4681,Biden is completely lost on stage. Lol<br><br>😅😅😅😅😅
4682,sleepy joe mumbling more than a soundcloud rapper
4683,"Also why is it that I have paid more in taxes in the last 3 years than I have since I started working in the 70s all together, But taxes have gone down for who. If taxes have gone down than why did the price of gas double in the first year Biden was in office? Why does food cost so much more now than it has in years. Where are all these breaks?  Why does Trump keep repeating himself? Why does Biden stumble all over his thoughts?"
4684,"Didn&#39;t Biden, shower with his daughter as a teenager?"
4685,My mother had a choice to abort me instead she had me and put me up for adoption so I would have a life if she would have supported me I wouldn&#39;t be here today so I am against roe versus Wade
4686,"&quot;And this footage is live, straight from the nursing home&quot;"
4687,Roe versus Wade
4688,"all the ones who question Biden looking weak, etc. that is the same argument you had 5 years ago. and you might even add that Trump is looking better than 5 years ago. would be better to find a valuable argument. the truth is both are too old to serve. just like the supreme court . should have an age limit. a lost generation leading the new. it would never work."
4689,"Cicero of the Roman empire wrote this about the situation during his lifetime<br><br>1. The poor, work &amp; work.<br>2. The rich, exploit the poor.<br>3. The soldier, protects both.<br>4. The taxpayer, pays for all three.<br>5. The wanderer, rests for all four.<br>6. The drunk, drinks for all five.<br>7. The banker, robs all six.<br>8. The lawyer, misleads all seven.<br>9. The doctor, bills all eight.<br>10. The undertaker, buries all nine.<br>11. The Politician lives happily on account of all ten.<br><br><b>Written in 43 B.C., but valid even today.</b>"
4690,"An 81-year-old person is having some problems that are common for people of that age. Wow, what a surprise!"
4691,Roe versus Wade what a joke
4692,Fake news channel CNN could not fix most of the debate - it was too transparent to everyone to see. Even two commercial breaks that never happen during Presidential debates did not help Joe to recover. And why host helps Joe to question Trump?
4693,Biden sucks!!!
4694,I wish we can have a trust worthy fact check about their claims because no one knows what really happens under each administration
4695,Yesss... Tell em T!
4696,We need several middle aged individuals to step up and run for the presidency so the American people can make a better choice moving forward.
4697,Trump ❤❤
4698,"Tapper got the first question wrong, it is the opposite, a $20 basket of groceries is now in some cases $100+."
4699,"Biden is a total waste of time, I couldn&#39;t even employ him in my business as a janitor, and he stole the election"
4700,Trump is terrible at enunciating himself. He&#39;s assuming the entire audience understands what Virginia&#39;s Governor was saying about abandoning born alive infants but many millions don&#39;t.
4701,"Bubbling Jo Biden. He just rambles and rambles, points the finger, rarely answers a question straight away... i just dont understand."
4702,Weekend at Bidens.
4703,Why does biden repeat everything twice ☠️
4704,"What on Earth is he talking about with the third trimester being between a woman and the state? Doe v Bolton was handed down the same day as Roe, and said abortions could be done during any trimester for reasons of health, and specifically defined health as anything at all that impacted a woman in any way. That has been the legal standard for 50 years."
4705,Everybody knows why all the illegal immigtants were let in.
4706,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=40313"">11:11:53</a> you can hear Biden fart"
4707,Biden the War Pig!! Pull out your Arm Forces here in the Philippines !!
4708,I pray for the Triumph of Trump!!🇰🇷🇺🇸👍👍
4709,Why no other candidates?
4710,I love how Biden is 86 years old he can’t walk and his son should be in jail. He should not be president.
4711,Biden is delusional! This is sad for America!
4712,Why does it seem that Biden is offered a chance each time to rebuttal but Trump is not unless he rebuttals after answering a question?
4713,"Why do we have 80 year olds leading the country?<br>Walk away from the power and influence and go sit in your chair, please"
4714,Biden clutching the name calling. He looks 108 but acts like he is 8. Go Trump!
4715,"WHAT MR. PRESIDENT TRUMP RELATIONSHIPS WITH WOMAN ADULT WOMAN IS PERSONAL WHEN YOUNG …. HE WAS NOT PRESIDENT FIRST HAND SECOND AND FORMOST HIS MONEY 💴 IS NOT FROM PRESIDENCY HE HAD FROM HIS DAD HIS WORK BUSINESS HIS SWET AND MIND .<br>YOU ON THE OTHER HAND BIDEN LIKE SNIFFING LITTLE GIRLS AND YOUR NOW WIFE WAS YOUR SON NANNY BABYSITTER ‼️ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=2782"">46:22</a>"
4716,LET RFK IN THE DEBATE&#39;S
4717,Btw.
4718,Lastly its not sleepy Joe...its too slow Joe. If you going to be slow you best have right words..<br>He is slow and the wrong words. <br><br><br>Trump is sharp and the right words.
4719,These two are the best we got? lol. One guy keeps going on endless rants showing he is a clear (sociopath) not answering any question directly. The other look like his memory failing him by the second. What happened to electing qualified people to be president? Why is there no age limit. Even the Military has an age limit.
4720,"I can&#39;t see that all those units that he&#39;s talking about are going to people that are illegally in this country and the American people that need housing cat daily squad.<br>That includes our bedroom, the store so far. It&#39;s okay. They&#39;re safe for those who wish to take our freedom away"
4721,Social Security is a scam. You would have 8-10x if you put that money in an IRA. Change my mind.
4722,Biden can&#39;t speak truth. He&#39;s a pathological liar
4723,Need one of them drug machines in the white house!  Asap
4724,Making billionaires play 24% tax will put a lot of people out of work got the billionaires of our country runs companies and they will have to cut jobs because of 24% tax hike
4725,Fact check every thing Trump claims!
4726,"That&#39;s my birthday open borders. Meeting that are some effects into our country. Okay. Matters saying how our children have to be watched. They weren&#39;t free getting all the benefits out of our taxpayer. So basically, the amount of people struggled to feed their families about these people that break the log on everything"
4727,Trump World 2024.
4728,I can conlude that Trump defeated old Biden
4729,LET TRUMP SETTLE THE WAR
4730,It was like Trump was for himself and Biden was for Trump too. Everything Biden said only strengthened Trump’s stance because it was all BS.
4731,Yeah manufacturing jobs in other countries
4732,"I watched the debate with my 19-yr-old son.  He will vote in his first election this fall.  We are of opposite political persuasion.  My son, about 35 minutes into the debate, &quot;Why won&#39;t they stop trying to insult each other and ANSWER the questions.  I don&#39;t care how the feel about each other!  I care how what they do will affect my future!&quot;  ......nothing else needs to be said....."
4733,YOUTUBE BLOCKS COMMENTS ❤
4734,Mumble wars
4735,Who built the cages Joe ? - Trump 2024
4736,THE WHOLE WORLD IS GOING TO BE DESTROYED IF YOU&#39;RE VOTING  BIDEN.
4737,Am I the only one that has a hard time understanding Biden ?
4738,Poor Joe Biden.  This man needs to go and rest in a convalescent home with some lime green jello.  This man is elderly and failing fast and is not fit to run his own household let alone our country.  His wife should be ashamed she is letting this happen.
4739,I&#39;d vote Biden even if he&#39;s dead over that Putin Bootlicker Trump.
4740,Biden is Made by china
4741,Joe keeps making up false lies that he actually believes! Nothing he has said has been true!
4742,BIDEN....WAR MONGERER❤
4743,You can’t let this man run the biggest super power in the world he can just about string a sentence together
4744,"Joe, you abd your handlers are IDIOTS"
4745,"Biden,Fauci ,And com"
4746,"America needs a STRONG president, who does not stutter and slur his words."
4747,"Biden knows no normal human being talks about income taxes as a percent of wealth , so he&#39;s expecting you not to notice he&#39;s doing it. Billionaires are paying nearly and in some cases over half of their income in taxes. 8% of wealth is a useless statistic."
4748,"I believe age isn&#39;t the main issue. President Biden may appear more tired because he is dealing with some of the worst global challenges in history. Former President Trump often lied and frequently provided false information, failing to adequately answer questions by resorting to misleading statistics and statements. I can trust a man who looks tired but honest; Biden was my winner of this debate."
4749,Opportunity Zones kills Black communities!! Both of these people have done nothing specific for just BLACK VOTERS. Student loans and insulin is for all people. Housing is for all people and the college money was always given.🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
4750,"No &quot;pre-written notes,&quot; yet what was Biden doing what looked like a clipboard of talking points? CNN, of course, showing favoritism to the Democrats. Or maybe just trying to remind him what he was doing since you could see his mind wandering off most of the time.<br><br>Also when the hardline and radical Democrats panic afterwards and consider replacing him...it should tell you something"
4751,HUNTER IS A CRACK HEAD LOSER❤

4755,Asking Trump what he&#39;ll do about &quot;addiction&quot; 😂😂🤣🤣😭
4756,"I can&#39;t believe you guys had an excellent platform and you did a great job. Kudos to CNN as mind-boggling because you spent so much time lying and being a representative for the Democrat party. I mean, they don&#39;t call you communist news network for nothing. But thank you for finally doing the right thingthis time I&#39;m sure"
4757,"All need to keep in mind…. “Starting” cognitive function….. only worsens with time, at the ages in play here…..  they don’t improve, they worsen…. We’re electing someone for a four year term….  This is not wise, to play roulette with what is already a highly questionable cognitive starting point."
4758,"What is black america? I only see the haves and the have nots.the haves are treated equally and the have-nots see no equality. Sincerely, a multi-racial True American."

4767,We love to see the national embarrassments take the stage.
4768,"If Biden gets re-elected, America is done. We know it, the rest of the world knows it. Scary stuff. Please vote with your brain and not your emotions. This is the most important election of our lives."
4769,REAL JEWISH PEOPLE PLEASE VOTE TRUMP ❤
4770,Even citizens from 4th world countries like Somalia believe that Biden is an embarrassment to the United States of America. Trump will win even the popular vote
4771,I just cannot listen to his (Biden&#39;s) Pre-prepared lies.  Biden and all on the left will be separated from those on the right.  Judgment is coming.
4772,"The delusion, the cognitive dissonance and gaslighting from the Democratic Party is amazing"
4773,AMERICAN SOLDIERS SHOULD QUIT OR VOTE TRUMP ❤
4774,I love how they have to tell Biden &quot;same topic&quot; when following up on abortion
4775,"THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS THE PASSAGE OF TIME BIDEN BECAUSE YOU ARE THE PASSAGE OF TIME IN A HORRIFIC DEMENTED DEMONIC WAY ‼️ ‼️ ‼️ <br>P.S<br>YOU DIDNT DO YOUR HOMEWORK 📚 GO EAT CHOCOLATE 🍫 CHOCOLATE 🍫 ICE-CREAM 🍦 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=2173"">36:13</a>"

4777,Biden the War Pig!!!!!!
4778,They used to shake hands and show respect to each other. How far we&#39;ve come and what a terrible example of how to be
4779,Two wings of the same bird. I’ve never seen so clearly corporate America run both party’s. They didn’t even talk about real issues and feed of each other incompetence.<br><br>A sad day for US citizens. Feels like the best candidate doesn’t even get a chance to prove himself. RFK Jr 2024 🇺🇸
4780,“They come and take black jobs” ????😂Which jobs are they?
4781,"If this format was used to prop up Trump and destroy Biden, good job!  Stopped watching CNN years ago, this didn&#39;t convince me to return.  Terrible on all accounts."
4782,SHUT UP BIDEN WE DON&#39;T WANT WARS IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO OR LATE ABBORTIONS❤
4783,Why are we even comparing Trump with that sloth.🦥
4784,Biden is so medicated he&#39;s dumb.  You were left a booming economy with low inflation and high employment.  Then you all ruined it.  He had no right to the questions ahead of time.  Sorry people cheat but God will get His revenge on you all.
4785,Joe Biden has done nothing he&#39;s taking credit for! Just ask the American people how hard the last 4 years have been!
4786,It&#39;s like 300$ for a basket of groceries idk where he shops. Dollar tree maybe
4787,Top attorneys in the U.S. say that Trumps cases will be overturned in appeals court. Just saying

4792,Both are fools and liars.
4793,Is there no other third candidate worth voting for? What&#39;s wrong with America?
4794,"I hate the immigration debate. If we wanted to fix it, we would make 20 years in federal prison the mandatory minimum sentence for HIRING an illegal immigrant. If the jobs they want are no longer open to them, they will stop coming, except for the cartel who have another business opportunity available to them. But watch, no more American grown food, no more roofers, carpenters, road workers. Multiple construction and service based industries would collapse. So, admit we need to figure out how to make these people pay taxes on their earnings, or make them citizens, or go ahead and implement the true solution by truly punishing the real criminal here, cheap businesses exploiting illegal immigration."
4795,"i feel a fresh person should run for this so important position of running a state, not a criminal and a kind man with a good heart but ill."
4796,Hmn a lot more than that. 100. To 120.  ?!? Um within three months my 60 count of eggs jumped from 5.68 to 25.00 example of just one bit...and dude uses a twenty dollar differencial....anyone who thinks we are a ok under this current legistlation needs to wake up.

4823,"Everything that happened yesterday in the CNN Debate was no surprise to me or anyone else, Joe Biden&#39;s terrible performance, his pale, sick face, without any quick reaction, unable to answer any questions, mainly due to his terrible US administrative performance. Game over, Joe Biden, you&#39;ve lost.

That is usually through a 401k plan, for most working people. Also note, when they say $25.00 there is a minimum investment. The stock is $25.00  per share. There will be a minimum number to buy or min. investment, to be able to invest. I am sure it is not, just $25.00 to start. And buying the this report, and the advise, is what anyone is buying. They are not investing by buying, the news letter, they are paying for the tips, as in where to invest, while investing, saving, etc.  Banyan is a known company. Banyan worked with former President Trump, also. There are many advise companies. I used to buy the subscriptions, I was always very interested in, it was reading material I enjoyed reading, through a few different companies. I enjoyed the reading material. Not everyone does. i can no longer afford to purchase the subscriptions or reading materials. It is like buying a book, you like to read. Your 401k materials, that come usually come quarterly, etc. Reading materials. just saying because not everyone understood, they were buying investing advise vs. investing."

4920,"Trump claims &quot;we had the greatest economy in the history of our country&quot;: False<br>Trump: &quot;We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. And we have never done so well. Every- everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us.&quot;<br>Details: Trump&#39;s claim is false that during his presidency the U.S. had the greatest economy in the history of the country by many of the common metrics used to judge economic performance. The claim struggles when looking at GDP. If the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation under Trump averaged 2.67%, according to figures from the World Bank. This is far from the GDP growth under Democratic President Bill Clinton of 4%, according to World Bank data. Including the time period after COVID spread, that average drops to 1.45%.<br>Trump&#39;s claim also falls short when compared to historical figures. Growth between 1962 to 1966 ranged from 4.4% to 6.6%. In 1950 and 1951, GDP ranged between 8.7% and 8%.<br>Under Mr. Biden, annual GDP growth is averaging 3.4%, according to the Associated Press.<br>Unemployment<br>Trump&#39;s claim is also false even when evaluating the unemployment rate.  In February 2020, a month before the COVID pandemic affected the economy, the unemployment rate stood at 3.5% — which was the lowest since December 1969 — but not the lowest ever. When Trump&#39;s term ended, the unemployment rate was 6.3%.<br>In 1953, the unemployment rate fell as low as 2.5%. Under Mr. Biden, the unemployment rate is 4%, according to the most recent data from May 2024.<br>In January 2023 and again in April 2023, the unemployment rate was 3.4%, lower than the best month during Trump&#39;s term.<br>Stock market performance<br>On Jan. 19, 2021, the S&amp;P 500-stock average closed at 67.8% above where it had been the day before Trump was inaugurated in 2017.<br>According to Investopedia, at the end of President Barack Obama&#39;s first term in office, the S&amp;P closed 84.5% higher. Additionally the S&amp;P gained 79% during President Bill Clinton&#39;s first term, and 70% during President Dwight Eisenhower&#39;s first term. So far, under President Biden, the S&amp;P 500 has increased almost 40%, according to calculations on June 13."

4942,According to Biden high inflation= great economy. 😮
4943,It’s like watching two dinner ladies arguing. America needs another young dynamic president like JFK was. Whether he/she will come from the democrats or republicans who knows.

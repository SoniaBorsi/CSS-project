71,Look what&#39;s happened now. Biden has fucked up everything and done worse than trump.<br>What&#39;s yall excuses?? ü§°
72,This debate was basically a 6th grade class debate between two kids while the helpless teacher is trying to make order but is almost helpless to do so. This debate was so much fun to watch.
73,Bro this was almost a year
74,"What a fun time, it was like tuning into reality tv"

80,Will go down as the worst debate between a president and nominee in history. This debate favored people that love cage matches.
81,God I&#39;m glad I voted for Joe!!!! Trump is an ignorant maniac. He&#39;s an embarrassment to our country.
82,How do you feel now you who voted for this incompetent and failed (fake) president?
83,"This clearly demonstrates how much of a liar Obiden is, how inaccurate he is, his hypocrisy over Covid, which is far worse under his regime, his treason, and the way he and Barry left an arsenal of weapons for ISIS just like they have for the Taliban and ISIS again.  He&#39;s incompetent, and being managed by Barry.  If you voted for him, you&#39;re an idiot.  Obamacare was/is a lie and a joke.  First thing Obiden did was shutdown the pipeline destroying over 10,000 U.S. jobs, and making us dependent of foreign oil again, thereby weakening the U.S. and strengthening our enemies like China, who own him and the left.  He props up China, pockets hundreds of millions on dealings, and is destroying the U.S.  There is no way this lying sack won the election.  On top of all that, you have one of the most devastating criminal pieces of evidence that damn him and Hunter, and POS mainstream lefty media buried the story and evidence.  Trump called out Biden&#39;s bullshit and communicated how Joe will go against his debate promises and start destroying America.  That&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening now.  Trump even stated &quot;you would&#39;ve left immigration and borders open and hundreds of thousands of infected illegals would coming pouring through our borders.&quot;. Again, President Trump was right.  Obiden failed with Swine Flu.  Failed!  Infected, unvetted and unvaccinated illegals are pouring through our border.  Again, President Trump called it.  Biden has been an empty suit his whole life.  When I listen to Biden, it makes me want to vomit!  Such BS.  It&#39;s sickening how Wallace favored dimentia and lies over a competent President who did the best job in office since Reagan.  Obama and Biden years were a joke.  Spying on citizens, FISA, Benghazi, empowering ISIS, supporting Muslim brotherhood, transporting $152 billion dollars of U.S. cash in the dark of night to Iran because Iran had their balls in a vice over lie of Osama bin Ladens killing by SEAL Team Six, weaponizing IRS against Republican candidates and party, and the list goes on.  No one even showed up to the few campaign rallies he held."
84,"Trump actually explained a plan and what is actually going on. You have to give him that tho the media played a dirty game, he did the right thing by us"
85,"Both Useless, madness in the USA.. get a proper president for crying out loud!"
86,Trump is a racist fool
87,"I can&#39;t wait until 2024, when Donald Trump will become the 2nd president in US history to be elected 3 times..."

267,Hindsight 20/20 all this complete BS the fighting was spewing all the way down to the fake gassing of people so he could take a picture with a Bible which has 100% been debunked shows how the Democrats lies and manipulation is the only reason they got anywhere near as many votes as they did
268,In hindsight Joe Biden saying Donald Trump appointing a judge is somehow an abuse-of-power when that man has written more executive orders in the first hundred and twenty days than any other president after previously acknowledging that that would pretty much be a dictator move he may be too old and senile to remember what he&#39;s done but I haven&#39;t forgot

274,"Hi Good morning,"
275,Let&#39;s get down to the root of the problem the average individual does not understand these debates because they honestly could not tell you with all truth what is the difference between Republican or Democrat or conservative or liberal. It comes down to empowering the individual to provide themselves with personal accountability instead of having somebody hold their hand their whole lives the same way you raise a child it&#39;s the same way you&#39;re raise a Nation
276,Every country the world&#39;s laughing at America right now at the end of the first quarter of 2021
277,We don&#39;t need moderators more than to ask simple questions and let the Dooley&#39;s sort it out no matter how long it takes the people want answers that&#39;s the only way that democracy works
278,Upon poignant investigation Every single Democratic awkward smile ends with<br>A subtle but noticeable insincerity.<br>If you were sincere why would you not have your game face on. Why would you laugh when being in charge of the fate of so many. This is not a laughing matter
279,"This mediator sucks. He can&#39;t control the debate. When he is trying to reel in Donald he sounds frazzled and the tone of his voice is annoying. When he keeps interjecting to attempt to control the conversation he doesnt complete his sentence because he is allowing donald to keep talking. So it&#39;s Donald talking when him interjecting, &quot;Don...&quot; &quot;Donald please&quot; &quot;Donald please let him&quot;&quot;Donald please let him talk&quot; or &quot;I unde...&quot; &quot;I understand but&quot; etc etc So it just sounds like a parrot and broken record and it makes it worse with that annoying high pitch voice he has and how he sounds under stress and like I said frazzled."

I am better than him‚Äù   He didn‚Äôt even give any concederte answers or reasons or anything like that. All trump did was shoot down Biden. I‚Äôm not saying I fully back Biden either; he has his flaws and he wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice for an ideal man in office. I just don‚Äôt know if anyone with more knowledge or brain cells related

Only way to have a true real democracy is to eliminate the need for this notion of a ‚Äúparty‚Äù Because as long as we have a republican or Democratic Party we the American people will suffer the most due to laws not being passed because of the biased opinion said party has about the other.

783,This debate probably lost him a couple of states
784,"Biden lost this debate just like he lost the election. He owes his Presidency to good old ingenuity. Genius shutting down the vote count overnight in 5 states Biden needed, but having people work tirelessly through the wee hours under the cover of darkness to flip the vote. Credit where credit is due. Finally after years and years and years of losing, Biden made it to the top. Too bad his dream finally came true though only after his criminality has been exposed for all to see and he is in cognitive decline."

807,"When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2018 because the market outburst in December 2017 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2018 it didn&#39;t work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this Expert Ronson Baylor so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money.<br>I will advise all traders or newbies to invest in his amazing platform.<br>Here is his contact via <br>Email Address:Ronsonbaylor @gmail .com<br>Tele gram: @Expert_Baylorfx<br>WhatsApp: ‚òéÔ∏è+ 1 5 0 9 3 4 2 7 0 7 7."

883,They just said that unemployment numbers are not going to be as low as the Trader Joes expected... That&#39;s why they JUST NOW extended the unemployment terms and that just resulted in MORE CITIZENS FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT to make EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE for enabling an easier turn around for the incoming party now being called the &quot;Trader Joe&#39;s&quot; Party
884,"TRUMP: &quot;Dr. Fauci himself said masks were not good&quot; MORE FACTS PROVEN TODAY ! Masks are ineffective and showed the same if not more spikes in the virus since. And it has also proven to weaken our immune systems so we believe we are sick , go get tested and endure false positive or negative results"

886,Someone should teach them the rules of debate XD
887,BIDEN CAMPAIGN : When you start losing the debate just bring up the Covid numbers and the people will follow<br>JOE BIDEN: Oh oh oh okkkay
888,"Biden said Trump knew about the virus back in February however he was called racist for trying to shut down China in January... Biden&#39;s hypocrisy has all unfolded and the coup has come to light. From the spying , to the Russian hoax, to covid...  Going all the way back to the Obama Administration.. They committed treason and conspired with China to get Trump out of office since we owed them 2 Trillion dollars.. which ironically is equivalent to Biden&#39;s Covid Relief Plan... You&#39;re Welcome people."

But when you believe the words of the world government&#39;s bitches who are just on the stage quoting stone age history, thats when the rest of us understand why you guys are the dumbest. Why dont you try learn a few things from the East maybe it will make the obese nation built on genocide and rape &quot;great&quot; again. We are all slaves but if we side with the elite&#39;s attempt to use our obsession with patriotism then what? Then you have failed as a human being. A hungry family is a hungry family. Put the guns down and use your brains for once. Wake up and demand change you trigger happy money freaks. We cannot evolve if we dont aim to acknowledge that WE ARE ONE RACE. And creating a virus to send into China clearly wont work either"

1027,"Just like Hillary in 2016 calling foul donald trump was never going to agree with losing not in 2016 not in 2020, you could have every investigative official in the world investigate his claims and until one of them says what he and his followers want to hear they will just say those investigators are in on the steal, they don&#39;t want proof that it was fair and free they want someone to agree with them so they don&#39;t have to eat crow and admit that their supreme leader actually lost against someone they called the worst candidate in history, i don&#39;t even like politics and don&#39;t care for either of these guys but this is common sense. Trump supporters don&#39;t want proof that the election was free and fair they want someone to tell them that their leader didn&#39;t actually lose to sleepy joe biden. they say biden hasn&#39;t accomplished anything in 47 years and then say he pulled off rigging an election without any court&#39;s charging him? come on you can&#39;t eat your cake and have it to. It was an election someone won someone lost we will have another election 4 years and possible it will be other way around with the other side claiming fraud like in 2016, it&#39;s a pattern people get angry when they lose both sides we saw it in 2016 and now in 2020. What we need to work on is knowing just cuz we vote doesn&#39;t mean the person we voted for is going to win, we are not entitled to win every election, America needs to learn how to lose gracefully again BOTH SIDES. There are no participation trophies in elections. period. Let&#39;s quit hurting each other and threatening each other over politicians who don&#39;t think of us other than us being a number, they don&#39;t lose sleep over us why are we fighting each other over them? if the shit hits the fan one day they are going to (all of them) are going to take care of themselves and we will be left to fend for ourselves and will need to lean on each other no matter what our political party use to be before said shit had hit the fan. spread love not hate please, we gotta do better."

1168,Trump&#39;s comments about election integrity aged like fine wine. If you support Beijing Biden you have some learning to do. Its easier for Biden to fool you than it is for anyone to convince you that you have been fooled.
1169,The only transitioning for Biden should be into a cell in Gitmo.

1312,"Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said after the US election that Kiev can get serious support from Joe Biden. Kostya Bondarenko is convinced that the former Ukrainian leader does not understand the essence of the issue. According to the expert, Poroshenko hopes that Biden in the presidential chair will remember the former friendly relations and support him. But it is better for the elected head of the White house not to touch the Ukrainian topic. &quot;Forget about words like Ukraine, Burisma, the hunter Biden scandal, and so on,&quot; Bondarenko said. We are talking about the corruption scandal surrounding the Ukrainian private oil and gas company Burisma. Biden&#39;s son hunter was on the company&#39;s Board of Directors. The newly elected us President Joe Biden is a native of the Ukrainian nobility, said Valery bebik, a Professor of political science at the national University of Ukraine. &quot;Few people know that Joe Biden is a distant descendant of the founder of the Zaporozhye Sich Vishnevetsky-Bayda. It was his great-great-great-grandfather-a London banker-who was given the gold of polubotka for safekeeping, thanks to which the United States of America rose,&quot; bebik said in the Ukrainian media. &quot;Gold polubotka&quot; - a popular pseudo-historical myth in Ukraine about how the &quot;Jewish plutocracy&quot; in the XVIII robbed Ukrainians."

1337,"The story of how Biden and Poroshenko for a billion dollars from Joe Biden fired the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, who began to investigate the son of Joe Biden, hunter Biden, the youngest son of us Vice President Joe Biden, became a member of the Board of Directors of Burisma in April 2014 (it also included former Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, a friend of the stepson of former Secretary of state John Kerry Devon Archer, and others). As part of the investigation into possible money laundering, the British authorities froze deposits in London banks for $23 million, which allegedly belonged to the owner of Burisma Zlochevsky. In Ukraine, a new scandal, and surprisingly not coronavirus. This week, the world finally saw and heard the documentary . We found out who exactly and what Poroshenko paid a billion dollars for-this is Joe Biden and the entire Obama army.<br>There are prospects for increasing gas production in Ukraine ‚Äî but this issue depends on the normalization of the investment climate in the country and the availability of the necessary funds, says Mikhail Krutikhin, senior analyst at Rusenergy. In his opinion, at a distance of about 10 years, Kiev can replace the volume of transit (or the volume of gas that is currently supplied to the country from European countries) with its own production. ... But after Joe Biden&#39;s frequent visits to Kiev and his statements about the corruption of the Prosecutor General, the need to rid Ukraine of dependence on Russian gas and the development of the shelf with the help of the Americans, the case was closed against Joe Biden&#39;s son hunter Biden."

1466,"Biden is f*cking useless, and having looked at other videos of him of how much of an incompetent talker he is, the man is going senile !? he&#39;s not fit to be a president. There&#39;s no way he got to this position on his own steam, he&#39;s a puppet and is being carried by those behind him. There is total voter fraud going on, it&#39;s so obvious, and the truth will prevail."
1467,Came after Biden won and I still can‚Äôt watch it. I won‚Äôt be happy unless Donald is dragged out kicking and screaming then goes to jail for life. The end.

I don&#39;t know if Trump is TRULY racist or not, I don&#39;t think I ever will be able to conclude as much unless I can read that idiot&#39;s mind. But he definitely has racist supporters which he refuses to condemn because he&#39;s afraid of making his base hate him.  That&#39;s why he seems racist overall, he has too much of an arrogant need for attention and that&#39;s caused him to side with racists in order to keep that attention and ego stroking."

Because of his recklessness and his arrogance, thousands of Americans died. Had he been worried about covid as he should have been. Maybe half of those people would still be with us today. Biden on the other hand, he wants to make dealing with covid his first priority. And if you ask me, saving lives is far FAR more important than anything else at the moment."

1875,Biden sucks
1876,"When a presidential debate is entertaining, even hilarious at times, something has gone seriously wrong."
1877,Sorry mr Biden but the elections have been tampered with. There are voices around saying that if Biden wins people over age 45 will go to paid retirement immediately leaving more work for youths . Im afraid that such endorsement is considerated stealing the elections. I wont mind to retire early but Im neither desperate or a sucker not believing that would happen. I don&#39;t know the motive behind when we all suckers in such winning endorsement but that is stealing the elections .  Certainly a fresh start.
1878,The moderater probably needed a drink
1879,"Even an ordinary person in a country in the Middle East has found that the Democrats have stolen the American people&#39;s vote and replaced it with a fraudulent one in favor of Joe Biden, which will tarnish their reputation in the US Federal Court and the US Supreme Court.

1928,It‚Äôs ridiculous to use the covid death count to blame Trump. Why not add the annual deaths cause by the flu to that as well? I don‚Äôt agree with everything Trump says or does but I also don‚Äôt like how his opponents are watching for any opportunity to put him under using any means. It‚Äôs nasty.

Millions of Americans graduate last every year perhaps they should be treated second class as well or as lesser citizens ! Hmmm by that logic those who graduated last from Havard should not even use the word smart with him.

2040,Trump&#39;s vocabulary is very limited and it is noticeable. I would at least like the president to sound smarter than myself or an Instagram influncer.
2041,I don&#39;t get comedy central right now so I&#39;m here
2042,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=3010"">50:10</a><br><br>I‚Äôm sorry but, it‚Äôs not Trumps fault people died from corona.<br><br><br>So, if Biden 2020 ends up being a thing, here‚Äôs what I gotta say, ‚ÄúHey look, you folks at home, how many of you woke up this morning and had a chair, perhaps with someone, but that someone lost their job because of Biden. And maybe that job is what was sustaining the family. And maybe even the person who lost their job was the only person working for the family, because someone, or maybe more than one, died because of COVID-19. Maybe this Christmas a family was wanting a really nice new Christmas tree, but now they can‚Äôt until they find a new job, and they may not even be able to find a better or even job with what they had before. This could happen to me. Also the socialism, haha. That‚Äôs crazy. Dems want Socialism, no electoral college, no guns, no oil industry, LGBTQ recognition, abortion, and BLM. So in other words they want Venezuela, a corrupt government, so protection, a butt ton of people to lose their jobs, support for a mental illness called gender dysphoria, killing of innocent babies, and support for a chaotic group of people who don‚Äôt believe in all lives matter and have killed more police than police have killed them and who have been in a lot of raiding looting and no peaceful protest, oh and I forgot they also want to remove a lot of history, and isn‚Äôt if odd that most of democratic history is them being really bad and messing up America. Back to the oil stuff, a lot of other jobs rely on the oil industry. And before you say, ‚ÄúBiden said he just wants to give less money to the oil industry, which he may be, a lot of jobs have bosses that say if Biden follows through with this fracking stuff, a lot of their workers will be laid off. This is bad for our country, can‚Äôt you see. I speak from knowledge and from my heart. I don‚Äôt really care how bad Trump may be, I know that Trump hasn‚Äôt absolutely destroyed America or we would be in chaos. With Biden, man, America will be destroyed if he follows through with anything he believes in. I know I can‚Äôt change the election, whatever happens happens, but I still want to give my thoughts, so that maybe in the future people will be able to actually want to improve America. I speak these thoughts not to be rude towards a party, or be super positive to another party, but to possibly help people realize what is wrong so we can do things right. I am only a kid. A middle class kid. I will say my age is above 12 but below 20. I hope future generations realize what the democrats want to do in order to corrupt the American government and turn it full blue. Whether your republican and democrat, you should understand what I am saying. I hope. Have a wonderful day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, year, and know that we may have just caused 2021 to be worse than 2020. I just wanted to get away from 2020, as did a lot of other people, probably you reading this too, but I guess it won‚Äôt happen. Unless Trump pulls it off in the end. Have a great day or night. And I need to make this clear too, which I wish I had put more emphasis on, but know that God is what we need, and that God is the best and only solution to this and everything. üòáüë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëßüë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëßüë©‚Äçüë¶üë©‚Äçüëßüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëßüë®‚Äçüë¶üë®‚Äçüëßüë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üë®‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëßüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è Think about God, Families, America, and The Future.‚Äù<br><br>From,<br>   The Konqor (That‚Äôs not my real name btw üôÉ)"

It&#39;s not that we even had strong views. We simply weren&#39;t interested in uncritical politically correct middle-class social etiquette or political platitudes. Of course, racists weren&#39;t welcome either - thankfully. However, WOKE liberals have become so insular and uncritical that decent people outside their ranks who have more complex (less black and white) views of the world are considered to be in the army of Satan.<br><br>They are so quick to scream &quot;Witch!! Witch!! Unclean pagans!&quot; at those they don&#39;t understand.<br><br>Their mode of thinking is just as uncritical as that of the hardened nationalist or religious fundamentalist. I suppose Trump is a counterbalance to asinine WOKE hegemony which has already done a lot of damage to the quality of education children and adults receive on campus.

The planning of a mutation of the Covid 19 virus with another virus called Covid 21 that will lead to a third wave with a much higher rate of infection and deaths, for February 2021 the &quot;new cases&quot; of hospitalization for Covid 19 and Covid 21 and if they don&#39;t find them they will create them!<br><br>4. Improved lockdown restrictions called third lockdown will be implemented with the total travel ban also between cities and countries, second quarter 2021 The inclusion in the universal income project, for the second quarter 2021 The planned interruption of supply chains and stocks, with great economic instability, expected for the end of the second quarter of 2021<br><br>5 Deployment of military personnel in metropolises and main roads to establish checkpoints and limit travel, in the third quarter of 2021<br><br>6. Parallel to this program, there has been talk of an unparalleled economic transition in which to force citizens.<br><br>7. To compensate for the international economic collapse, the federal government will offer a cut in debt, personal debt, loans, mortgages, thanks to the IMF as part of the global debt reset program, in exchange citizens will forever lose their private property of any property and will have to participate in the covid 19 and covid 21 vaccination program thanks to which they will be able to travel even in full lockdown with a health pass for Canada. The same is true for all countries of the world.<br><br>8. Committee members asked who will own the confiscated assets, and what will happen to the lenders: the answer was only that the IMF&#39;s debt reset program will take care of all the details. Absolute nothing.<br><br>9. Other members wondered what will happen to citizens who refuse to participate in the IMF World Debt Reset and the Health Pass, and the response was that the members of the Committee must come up with a plan to do everything possible to prevent it from happening. never refusal, and that goes in the interest of all citizens to participate.<br><br>10. Those who refuse will live indefinitely locked up, and those who refuse the World Debt Reset program will be considered a public health risk, and will be locked up forever if they do not accept the debt cancellation program.<br><br>This is what was released by a member of the Canadian Liberal Party who attended a meeting of the Canadian Government&#39;s Technical Programming Committee. This is the program for all countries around the world.<br><br>All members who objected or asked questions were ignored.<br><br>When I told you that the point nobody wants to talk about is money, but that is what moves the evil?<br><br>And that it is this that must be reformed in the sense of cash, distribution, and not debt to third parties.<br><br>Now you know‚ùó‚ùó<br>For those who don&#39;t wake up, know that you will have the future of your grandchildren and children on your conscience!<br><br><a href=""https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=145918080595994&amp;id=101789008342235"">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=145918080595994&amp;id=101789008342235</a>  <br><br><a href=""https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=145951500592652&amp;id=101789008342235"">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=145951500592652&amp;id=101789008342235</a><br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35cdGItFazI"">https://youtu.be/35cdGItFazI</a><br><br>Abp.

If you actualy look it up on articles and other things online, you can find out that most abortions take place after the baby is not a what they like to call &#39;&#39;fetus&#39;&#39; anymore, its a baby with arms, legs, feet, and a head. But everyone doesn&#39;t like hearing that because its the truth, and they want to make it seem okay to keep doing what they are doing. Hate me for being a Trump supporter, Hate me for being against anarchism,  Hate me for being against abortion, Hate me for saying its wrong to have kis that are just 5 years old come on tv shows, and other videos an talk about what men they find attractive, when they have barely just got out of pre-school.

We&#39;ve lost 90% of the care providers at our local VA. My dad has a serious condition--NOT Covid, thank whatever--and the PA he&#39;s been assigned is incompetent and refuses to see him in office. We were told constantly by her to have him checked up at the mobile unit, as we live far from our main VA office.They were never there. We just found out that they never INTENDED to be there; they were pulled out of commission as long as Covid is going around. We tried to take him to the ONLY local VA Approved clinic in town; they have no handicap accessibility, which he needs. My sister, who is largely my father&#39;s care provider, was told by VA that they had no control over that. The clinic that are APPROVED by VA are NOT REGULATED BY VA. Think about tHAT for a moment. She was told by the VA to contact the clinic and push to have handicap facilities implemented. In other word, they wanted my sister to do THEIR FUCKING JOBS FOR THEM! Because they&#39;re NOT culpable in the maintenance of these &#39;VA Approved&#39; facilities. Think about THAT for a minute. I HATE Biden, but my HATRED for Trump is FAR more grievous.

2289,It&#39;s clear that Trump is not a true politician and doesn&#39;t have the best interest of the American people in his mind and heart. To him it is a popularity contest. He only really wants the title. It&#39;s time to have someone in office that will help people that need it.
2290,More jobs was created in the final 3 years of Obama&#39;s 2nd term than the 1st 3 years of Trump&#39;s term.
2291,He&#39;s barricading himself in the white house!

2294,Trump acts like a fool.  Please end this White House Reality Joke Show Trump created.  4 years was enough of him. Vote Biden who is more deserving to be the President.
2295,I am looking at this debate again.  Trump is a pig and can&#39;t let anybody else have a say.  Joe Biden did the best he could and I challenge anybody to remain calm under those circumstances.  Chris Wallace was a terrible moderator and let Trump go on and on over the top.

Trump has been under constant scrutiny for every reason under the sun. Had he been censored from the getgo and had Back to the Future 2 had a different villain, very few would find something to complain about. He doesn&#39;t speak a politician&#39;s language (aka bullshit lies disguised as confections with pretty packaging) he will speak lamens terms, although I will admit, sometimes it sounds like series of farts in a baron cornfield after harvest. Before Trump, people were against most things political, control of the people etc... Biden isn&#39;t your solution. Your tax dollars have been going down the crapper since time immemorial, and never before have news stations been so biased, enough to lie to everyone in order to shift the votes in the direction these elitist asswipes want it to go, and these puppeteers will pull any strings they have to to convince you that Trump has been a terrible president thus far, when that is simply not the case.

Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! <br>My second question is: Are you a supporters and encouragers of so-called personal freedoms, freedom of demonstrations, and freedom of expression of opinions, freedom of religions, equality between men and women and same sex marriage?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! <br>My third question is: Is the death penalty abolished from your judicial systems because you consider it as a savage barbaric act and not suited to the contemporary man?? Your answer is: of course it is!... absolutely yes!!<br>My fourth and final question is: What do you do to the murderers? Where do you place them?? Do you put them in a resorts you call it jails!! in order to eat the best food and to exercise sports and to practice fitness on the latest sports equipments, and to watch TV and to use the Internet and to read books, magazines and newspapers in their clean place which equipped with a central heating and cooling all the times, and always you provide them a health care at all levels, And from time to time you supply them a new outerwear and underwear and pyjamas and perfumes and new shoes, and you protect them around the clock ,and no anybody has the right to touch them badly at all or to threaten them or to abuse them physically or verbally ,and nobody has the right even to annoying them or to disturb them at any time ,and on top of all of that they are not demanded to pay a cent for the costs of that wonderful life, but in fact the families of their victims are demanded to pay the costs for all of that from their own looted money which you call it TAX?? Your answer is: of course we do!... absolutely yes!!  <br>Well.... according to your answers, it is very clear and it is very obvious that Without a feeling, and without noticing, and unintentionally you are the ones who definitely creating the environment for the existence of violence, hatred and crimes, and you are the ones who inciting and encouraging all of that to be existed continuously and to be spread and to be exacerbated. <br>Now listen carefully what I am going to say ‚Ä¶..<br>Allah is the Lord of the worlds, and he is the Creator of the worlds, and all the human beings are one of His creations, Allah has graciously revealed His mercy to mankind , His mercy is the Religion of Islam ... and the Quran is the Words of Allah which are addressed to all human beings, Quran is a sacred and a Holy words, It is the Constitution from the Creator to the people , The whole Quran is a completed and integrated unit...it is cannot be followed and obeyed some of Quran verses and ignore the rest , in order to please people and to satisfy them!.<br>The non serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God&#39;s constitution in the whole earth means a disbelief in God and a hypocrisy in its clearest form ... and it means the recognition and the acceptance of the existence of crimes in all forms in everywhere...and that will be the reason for the destruction of all human societies in all their differences.<br>The serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God&#39;s constitution in the whole earth means a real protection and a real preservation to all people in everywhere. <br>Do you find up to this point that these words inciting violence, hatred and terrorism!?... Or you think the denying of God&#39;s existence and to his constitution and to eradicate Islam religion would be the best option and the superior choice ?!.. In order to embrace your laws and to please you and to satisfy you and to avoid your anger and to be that a clear obedience to your laws which inciting the ignorance, crimes and corruption in the whole earth.. Which been created by God.. And which only God own it !! <br>Blessed be Allah who says : (( Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?)) , Allah is the Lord of the worlds and He is the Dominator to his creatures He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers )) , and He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers )) , and He said: ((Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners)). God does not call for violence and hatred, in fact he encourages and motivates and forces people to live in the earth as He wills...Not to live every person as he likes and wishes ,  Allah is the only Creator...he is our Creator. <br>No one can understand the God&#39;s Justice and His divine logic except those who have the ability to understand and to think and to conceive through the pure logic. <br>God has wrathed and cursed and prepared a terrible punishment to anyone who believes in some of His words and deliberately ignores the rest of them, He said : (( Do you believe in part of the Book and defy another part?

His first wife also recommended that for him. He has tried running a country for 4 years now so what thrill is left for him in the future? Why put up with all the crap?

2698,Biden is not against opening the economy..He is for opening CAUTIOUSLY..with science backed data and with proper health protocols in place. He is thinking twice and speaking once.

Then offers no explanation, but an ad misericordiam argument. Sorry folks, this is all BIG SMOKE because the Dems--hate to enlighten you--think you&#39;re stupid and they know what&#39;s best. Biden knows damn-well that we all have the right to our own moral sentiments. You can&#39;t standardize non-prejudice. That&#39;s part of a local-cultural background. To offer explicit awareness training is purely policing ideology on the pretty side of the table (this time around). WAKE UP! They are causing the division! They don&#39;t benefit from racism or poverty falling. They&#39;d have no votes. They bank on you being interested in short-term gains, and after 30 years when they don&#39;t deliver--oh, well, we&#39;ll put Pelosi or Hilary in a leather jacket and teach her another line of Spanish. See, the Dems play on these issues. Trump talks agenda and infrastructure. The left only gives you HATE SPEECH--like, &quot;he&#39;s a bad boy&quot; and other reactionary agendas. Idiots should have gone back to the drawing board, figured out what you actually stood for, and redefined the party and found new representation to deliver it. Instead, they wasted 4 years trying to lynch the winner! THIS IS a democracy! Don&#39;t vote if you can&#39;t accept the possibility of loss. We don&#39;t live in a monarchical society. It&#39;s one term. Chill the fu*^ OUT! And stop the loaded question about condemning white supremacy. That plays into their hand. Then they turn around and say, SEE, HE LEADS THEM. NO! He has no more reason to do so than Biden. I&#39;d be insulted! I would neer address those low-rent assh(&amp;&amp;Y as the President. Shame on these liberals for commandeering real issues of social inequality for their own self-serving political gains. Seriously, when someone talks to you like you need a handout... ask what thefu*&amp; these people are up to. You think Obama established healthcare penalties because he loves us or something...wake up! They&#39;ll be singing John Lennon songs while we approach 0% exports with 230% tax on the speculative possibility of exports--and the new silk road pulls out with every import we depend on... short term gains.  Liberals run the country like California runs its State!"
2718,JOE BIDEN IS A MENTAL MAN AND A PERVERT!!!

2720,Yeah go faster making a vaccine.  Let&#39;s not be careful on not making a mistake that could actually kill people. Let&#39;s not worry about making mistakes. Let&#39;s just throw chemicals as fast as we can into a tube and inject into people and hope it doesn&#39;t kill them or cause other health damages.  The faster you work on something the more likely it is for you to make a mistake. Keep that in mind.

Why should these, in a world subject to the immutable law of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration that must needs overtake every human institution?

He claims to be against locking up drug <br>users, and yet his VP Kamala Harris was incredibly aggressive in locking<br> up marijuana users during her term as California Attorney General.

Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! <br>My second question is: Are you a supporters and encouragers of so-called personal freedoms, freedom of demonstrations, and freedom of expression of opinions, freedom of religions, equality between men and women and same sex marriage?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! <br>My third question is: Is the death penalty abolished from your judicial systems because you consider it as a savage barbaric act and not suited to the contemporary man?? Your answer is: of course it is!... absolutely yes!!<br>My fourth and final question is: What do you do to the murderers? Where do you place them?? Do you put them in a resorts you call it jails!! in order to eat the best food and to exercise sports and to practice fitness on the latest sports equipments, and to watch TV and to use the Internet and to read books, magazines and newspapers in their clean place which equipped with a central heating and cooling all the times, and always you provide them a health care at all levels, And from time to time you supply them a new outerwear and underwear and pyjamas and perfumes and new shoes, and you protect them around the clock ,and no anybody has the right to touch them badly at all or to threaten them or to abuse them physically or verbally ,and nobody has the right even to annoying them or to disturb them at any time ,and on top of all of that they are not demanded to pay a cent for the costs of that wonderful life, but in fact the families of their victims are demanded to pay the costs for all of that from their own looted money which you call it TAX?? Your answer is: of course we do!... absolutely yes!!  <br>Well.... according to your answers, it is very clear and it is very obvious that Without a feeling, and without noticing, and unintentionally you are the ones who definitely creating the environment for the existence of violence, hatred and crimes, and you are the ones who inciting and encouraging all of that to be existed continuously and to be spread and to be exacerbated. <br>Now listen carefully what I am going to say ‚Ä¶..<br>Allah is the Lord of the worlds, and he is the Creator of the worlds, and all the human beings are one of His creations, Allah has graciously revealed His mercy to mankind , His mercy is the Religion of Islam ... and the Quran is the Words of Allah which are addressed to all human beings, Quran is a sacred and a Holy words, It is the Constitution from the Creator to the people , The whole Quran is a completed and integrated unit...it is cannot be followed and obeyed some of Quran verses and ignore the rest , in order to please people and to satisfy them!.<br>The non serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God&#39;s constitution in the whole earth means a disbelief in God and a hypocrisy in its clearest form ... and it means the recognition and the acceptance of the existence of crimes in all forms in everywhere...and that will be the reason for the destruction of all human societies in all their differences.<br>The serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God&#39;s constitution in the whole earth means a real protection and a real preservation to all people in everywhere. <br>Do you find up to this point that these words inciting violence, hatred and terrorism!?... Or you think the denying of God&#39;s existence and to his constitution and to eradicate Islam religion would be the best option and the superior choice ?!.. In order to embrace your laws and to please you and to satisfy you and to avoid your anger and to be that a clear obedience to your laws which inciting the ignorance, crimes and corruption in the whole earth.. Which been created by God.. And which only God own it !! <br>Blessed be Allah who says : (( Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?)) , Allah is the Lord of the worlds and He is the Dominator to his creatures He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers )) , and He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers )) , and He said: ((Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners)). God does not call for violence and hatred, in fact he encourages and motivates and forces people to live in the earth as He wills...Not to live every person as he likes and wishes ,  Allah is the only Creator...he is our Creator. <br>No one can understand the God&#39;s Justice and His divine logic except those who have the ability to understand and to think and to conceive through the pure logic. <br>God has wrathed and cursed and prepared a terrible punishment to anyone who believes in some of His words and deliberately ignores the rest of them, He said : (( Do you believe in part of the Book and defy another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do ))‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. <br>Mazen Alargha"

He said same thing during first election.<br>3.) Evaded question on separating 500 childrens to asking who built jails instead of answering why they separated. Building jails is not bad but making inhuman decisions is crime as Biden said.<br>4.) He knew in January how severe this decease is but said it will vanish soon because it will effect his business. <br>5.) He is racist and has done nothing to black community. We&#39;ll know what he thinks about all communities except white people and mind you only RICH WHITE. <br>6.) HE insulted other countries calling Russia, China, India as filthy but when he was in India he said India is great, nice and love India.... He is two faced. <br>7.) Trump is tuff only to countries like Iran, Syria, Palestine which are poor, helpless, and military is not strong. North Korea violated all their promises but he did not put sanctions. <br>8.) When asked about NKorea he said Kim is friendly with him but what about his breaches? Iran does nothing but he orders to kill their Generals. <br><br>Trump on 1st presidential election podium said he evades tax... That&#39;s enough for Americans tax department to put him behind bars let alone context for presidency. If he gets elected Americans are most niave people."

3431,I love how the mod has to ask questions cause Biden is to numb to. This was a president debate not a moderator debate the moderator needs to go find another job get fucked and stop looking like he something important because he‚Äôs just a fucking moderator and Biden should step up his game a little because clearly he‚Äôs going to have the moderator ask questions because he‚Äôs too incompetent to President Trump won this by a long shot Biden is clearly mentally challenged and hast to have a crew of people around them at all times to develop questions because he‚Äôs too incompetent to

3444,I support one of these men but im saddened to see that in my opinion neither of them have the class to hold high office.
3445,I am starting to really see that everything on TV is staged so whats real anymore? Just think for decade&#39;s upon decades TV has been scripted for viewers and the more false reality people tune into the more they generally become what they see on it and the actions towards it. If someone who never seen TV and how emotions or thoughts or actions have been betrayed during situations it will be totally a different reaction. (aside from people in your life who do watch TV)I guess i am trying to say its like dressed in fully upscale brand name clothing but your jewlery is fake a little of real with fake!
3446,Biden seems to stumble alot on his thoughts i think it may be due to the stress and nerves that effects him

3476,BIDEN=MADE IN CHINA     TURMP=MADE IN AMERICA
3477,Honestly Think about it nothing in this country truly make sense when it comes to the laws of the land For instance How we vote in this country makes no sense So the popular vote is the peoples vote  But the people&#39;s vote is not used to pick the president the electoral college picks the president meaning the senators that the people voted into power to be in this  The senate speaking for them on their behalf Isn&#39;t really speaking on their behalf If the popular vote for president can be outweighed by the electoral college vote When the senators in the electoral college or supposed Place their voteBy the standards of their extensions Meaning by the standards of the people that voter for them in their States But what&#39;s going on is this if the president that the people pics and that state is not the one that the senator of the state once the senator of the state is not going to put the people&#39;s choice on their ballot there going to put their choice on their ballot and that&#39;s the reason why Hillary Clinton was not president because the people voted her to be president but the electoral college did know fuck the people This country is built and made for the people by the people So technicallyThe older women in the older man we have in the senate has been there for 60 years or basely pissing and shitting on the corpse of or forefathers because this is not what our fore fathers saying for America at all Basically was going on is a bunch of white men fighting in bigger because a group of them once everyone in this country to be looked at as equal human beings see that&#39;s the problemThe Declaration of Independence And the Constitution was written black people workers city as animals we were not considered human meaning animals do not have rights to themselves nor land This is truly with their ordering over The Empire meant of the black society within America A lot of caucasians in America is scaredOf the black ecosystem within America becoming strong enough To support black people as a whole in America meaning Blacks in caucasians Being equal yet severed And what that will do to the Caucasian ecosystem Is take wealth from it That is one thing that caucasians love more than life property and money This is why this country is how it is Fossil fuel is exactly what it sounds like fossil fuel it is not plentifulIf people were to really do their research on what fossil fuel truly is they will understand that it is not something that will be here for everlasting But as long as we take care of this planet will forever have solar energy When to run turbines And even now companies like Tesla run their course of a battery And do not need fossil fuel at all And drives Just As fast End aS for of the  So  distance So what is the real reason why degree new bill having been passed and probably won&#39;t be passed

3491,And when you speak on the state&#39;s being closed down in a high divorce rate that&#39;s because majority of these people that are getting married to each other should never have been married to each other if they can&#39;t spend more than 4 hours around each other we work 8 hours A-day come home  For 4 hours go to sleep and wake up to work another 8 hours We in America not Work to live we live to work And if you can&#39;t spend a week around your spouse without ordering with your spouse over frivolous things It was never love they were married for stability not love when the stability of that Union is jeopardised That you enough stability breaks down there is no love and that form of Union So honestly if Joe Biden was the set this country down in pay people to sit in the house for let&#39;s say 4 months straight but literally pay people to wear their lively expenses can still be Taking care of Maybe there wouldn&#39;t be so many divorces Maybe they wouldn&#39;t So many foreclose houses Maybe there wouldn&#39;t be so many Small businesses shutting down And I find it funny have majority of the small businesses that are being shut down or on by people of colour meaning blacks hispanics or Chinese  And everyone is turning a blind I To the fact how many McDonald&#39;s has closed down How many targets has shut down Walmart Grocery stores If you were a multibillion near at the beginning of the pandemic you are basically a billionaire now So meaning if you are a chainOf different Splinter sales of your company you received a hell of a bailout during the Corona  And look at it how New homeless people have this virus created

3594,Laughed so hard when trump kept cutting Biden off üòÜ
3595,"I thought Chris Wallace was very disrespectful of President Trump. Even laughing at the President, who deserves more respect than that. I saw both presidential debates and Trump acted perfectly presidential in both of them."
3596,"&quot;When you&#39;re born you get a ticket to the freak show. When you&#39;re born in America, you get a front row seat.&quot;<br>- George Carlin"
3597,"WARNING: This is my opinion, and I‚Äôm not disrespecting anyone‚Äôs political views because we all have our reasons for who we support and all have different lives. But watching this debate, I can see how Biden often deflects from actually answering the question and tries to pull us Americans in emotionally in a manipulative way, which is not something I want in a president. He tries to demonize President Trump for shutting down the economy because of COVID-19 when he would have no idea how to handle it himself. In fact, he would make the economy worse if he were elected because he wants to keep ObamaCare which is super expensive and is promising ‚Äúfree‚Äù things that aren‚Äôt really free and are paid by giving everyone ridiculously high taxes (except for him and the rich people). Also, he wants to talk about women‚Äôs rights yet is okay with a child being murdered because it should be a woman‚Äôs ‚Äúchoice.‚Äù Why doesn‚Äôt the baby get a choice? It‚Äôs the baby‚Äôs life being taken from them. I understand that sometimes there are terrible circumstances and a woman is scared to have the child, but it‚Äôs still MURDER. If you killed someone you saw on the street, you would go to jail for life for it, but if you kill a growing baby, heartless people celebrate your ‚Äúright‚Äù to choose instead of admitting that it‚Äôs murder no matter what pregnancy term the mother was in or the circumstances of the pregnancy. I won‚Äôt vote for a liar, manipulator, and advocate for murder. President Trump supports pro-life, lower taxes than what Biden would cause, a healthcare that would be better than Obamacare, the military, and family values. Don‚Äôt buy into the lies of men like Biden just because he gets good press. Instead of relying on what the media tells you, think for yourself and do your research. President Trump is gonna win this election and continue to make America great again. And even if you hate me or disagree with me for all that I just said, I respect your political views even if they‚Äôre different than mine. Because we‚Äôre all human beings at the end of the day just trying to make our country better. God Bless Youüôèüèª"
3598,"The 200000 people that died, how many of them survived p? Well...."

3610,Anybody just jumping from the second debate for this one to have fun?
3611,"Both candidates may not be the best choice but out of the two Trump is the best choice. He&#39;s built us a wall, he tells us things other presidents keep away from us,  he let us know about fake news,  he tells us about the media&#39;s lies, he gave us stimulus, he gives his entire check back to the treasury,  and there&#39;s many more.  Biden and his family are corrupt.  Biden wants to take our second amendment right what he calls assault weapons which is all weapons away from us.  He&#39;ll flood the supreme Court and try to change the Constitution. He touches and smells little kids. He&#39;s also a Democrat that should be enough.  Vote TRUMP 2020 people."

3650,"Dosent President trump donated his presidency check, wow so generous to the needy but scams taxs. I don&#39;t take it for what they want us to take it. I understand completely Biden dosent even try to be serious about anything and it could be possible President trump has a gift of can. Biden definitely could not have the gift of gab sense he just uses his name and connections to not get what he wants cus he can only be used as a puppet by his own family if he didn&#39;t talk to his son and son business.    that means his son just went and used his father for personal gain no matter the outcome for Biden in yet Biden is covering up for son and defending his son just so son can think of ya I can be f up and get away with it. used himagain his own son"

Honestly,he hasn&#39;t done anything good except talking shit! You can see China has done pretty well to stop covid19 spreading inside the country. What about Trump? He&#39;s just blaming China and other countries that he doesn&#39;t like? What&#39;s wrong with him? It&#39;s not healthy to split the people in 2 groups! So many conflicts and hates! We should focus on our lives! Not on this stupid politicians and elections! No matter what promises by those politicians, their purpose is only for the power and money. Do you really think they really care about you poor people? All about money and power! It will never ends! It&#39;s a circle."

We‚Äôve all lied and we‚Äôve all stolen, which makes us liars &amp; thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all. <br><br>The problem is, we can never ‚Äòoutweigh‚Äô our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death &amp; hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect &amp; sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, &amp; endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‚Äòit is finished‚Äô.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death &amp; rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;<br><br>Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, &amp; through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, &amp; the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .<br><br>The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, &amp; also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You‚Äôve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don‚Äôt even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27);<br>‚ÄòIt is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT‚Äô.<br><br>All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .<br><br><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117750/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KttEFbESFBVEC"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117750/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KttEFbESFBVEC</a>"

3821,"My thoughts on the debate. Trump made a nice comment putting fault on neither of the pandemic, however if Trump wants to play golf one day after week he should be able to, I like the low shade regarding Joe biden&#39;s son issues that was vicious, 99% but I understand I was in the slow class in math too(4real it was about 10 and I still graduated from college), Trump opening schools regardless if the school has active Covid..yikes, Liked Walk and Chew Gum, Loved Trump&#39;s Facial expressions hopefully it will be used on Tik Tok some how,  true what Trump stated about New York but the country is living in a time where people Do not have the money to waste on Gucci belts, Comparing Dr. Fauci to making a mistake verse the President making a mistake for his country, Loved Trump saying he got People in Wall Street to show his Clout, liked the woman of color hosting, her lashes and talking to Trump like a Junior High Teacher for him to focus,, loved the explanation of Sovereignty, loved the Orange glow but his hands don&#39;t match his face, Bob Barker 1st Cousin, Top Crip Representative and Top Blood Rep with an OG gangsta lean, love to watch rich people argue about poor people, I said &quot;You Do&quot; and was mad he didn&#39;t say it again, How THE HELL DO U PREPAY TAXES cus I&#39;ll prepay $20 and keep it moving.. damn White Privilege..lmao..,  too shady Trump Talking trash about his Brothers, loved the Flip Flop Trump talking trash on China but said he thought about working with them..lol.., Loved hearing White People say Malarchy, Trump saying Typical Politician but he is a politician, his love for the people of Seoul, Biden said Trump got thugs for friends lol, Confused on &quot;I could have gone the other route and everyone would have been unhappy&quot;, felt like Trump was staring directly at me (wtf was the other route. NEW World Order?), Melania looking like a nija because she is mersible, Loved Biden&#39;s smooth pimp daddy laugh, Trump low flirt with the host, damn he ain&#39;t even from Scranton, Alabama is Different from NY??? Maybe fashion but we all need to survive..damn, OMG People coming over on Coyotes instead big saying Donkeys, Who built the cages? Damn. Cages!!, The enlarged eyes Of Trump when Biden talked about freeing those immigrant children, A rapist is a very bad person too as Trump could not think of another Option, Perry Mason shout out, Lowest IQ can come back to the country, 500 kids not knowing where their parents are and said  Good?!?!?! As a DCPP investigator And have worked with DV victims from their Husbands who beat them and tell them they can&#39;t call the police because they are illegal and the children have to witness this every day and night..not cool, Trump said he Helped Two Black people with loans....lol..&quot;I&#39;m the least racist&quot;?!?!?lmao.. means you have racism thoughts and possibly ways..and to honest WE ARE ALL RACIST ON THE LOW..but when you have to leave your feelings at home and put on a fake ass smile in the world...Why not say He is not racist, because it wouldn&#39;t be realistic for anyone.  Wow someone calls u a racist and your mad about Abraham Lincoln comment.. lmao,  Loved Trump saying &quot;These Politicians, ALL TALK NO ACTION WAS THE BEST, Trump confusing Vice President Biden position from President Obama running the country, AND I MISSED THE EAGLES GAME. Pissed"

Hell, most of you never hear anything Trump actually does. Do your research... Biden is a racist..&quot;Poor kids are just as talented and smart as white kids&quot;..&quot;super predator&quot;...Joe Biden quotes.

All of sudden riots racism, liberals think we the people are so stupid. This is all happening because they are trying to make trump look bad and blaming him for all this. Dems need to give it up.

4021,They should debate without a moderator. To many good points being cut off geez he gave Biden more time to talk
4022,Amy Coney Barrett is anything BUT liberal.
4023,"We are all doomed. Trump is a child, and Biden is in love with money. We truly are in the worst timeline."
4024,"The marshmallow at the end of the stick - the most anyone needs to live life independently and retire, $100,000 a year - is the democratic figure, by which the majority of people who say it&#39;s a terrible time to be black, as the 538 website reports, or something else that bad, would politically benefit from a cap on incomes of those who provide services would live in a world where the major commercial developments, of space for instance, could be publicly owned.  And that way other industries such as the media would be more easily regulated rather than serve as personal platforms for utter destructiveness to individuals.  But there&#39;s a hitch:  that is not a permanent likelihood ever for a shifting back and forth politics;  now that the far left communists have been shut out and effectively erased by the media, as anything on behalf of those who would have unified the world for that common goal of respects, including the moral ones to empower moderately well-off individuals (straight white and middle income along with the whole slew of other factors) of ways to advance/provide/develop environments of global inter-connected interests.  The way in which torture developed as a common bargaining right and offer/option in all forms of everyone&#39;s lifestyle and it definitely did and skyrocketed as such, for people who believe in animals and their lives/rights, wasn&#39;t necessary - that&#39;s what frames anyone so brutalist to still be unwittingly servicing the whole enterprise of greatly evil personal projection.  None of it was at all good or necessary except in the common democracy purely and absolutely for men only, and that is fundamentally so, with a period.  It completely has zero grace of women.  Only the servicing of the same old right-wing swathe of mentalities creating a foundation of abuse and demands for hidden horror contains their same rising desire into sins unable to be matched by what&#39;s lost in that decision to wipe out the democratic class chance as more sophisticated than the opposite to the first mentioned point;  the greed to acquire, acquire, acquire, and make sense, of the simple right of the rule of cash as law.  It isn&#39;t moral, and wickedly over-moralized the concept of freedom as the least possible not just probable of a higher capacity so to have that human part of the lasting character over and with as part of the world.  That points out that we are as part of our environment possibly affecting our inclinations democratic as such and not just nature, which goes farther and that does guide some individuals even up to the level of science in some completeness, which exaggerates oftentimes its claim, as a philosophy, of the mechanics of reason to it purely;  but that can be confused, and there is some simple humanity and freedom within its limits, and not just in ways a new, holistic but demanding culture is raising perhaps the majority of liberals in a state more unfamiliar as humane to some escapees such as hippies and their sense of freedom, and the role of the limited focus otherwise of love as eternal.  Be kind.  Torture is not kind.  That proliferated over the last decade.  That was a moral evil, that didn&#39;t always retreat or retract."

4030,"With the revelation on the Chinese energy firm, we have direct evidence (the smoking gun) that Hunter and Joe Biden were both involved in Hunter&#39;s personal money-making ventures from political connections. There is no way around this. The Democrats and the Media are backing a corruption filled dynasty, and they will continue to do so while blatantly denying the sun shines. Why? I said before, it has nothing to do with Trump or Biden, everything to do with a global socialist agenda. The vicious lies and attacks from the Democratic Left has to be put down or America is asking for its own demise. Is sacrificing America and it&#39;s freedoms worth the hatred of a single individual?"

4121,You Trump supporters are all a bunch of brainwashed motherfukers try using your mind or don&#39;t you have one? Is our country better or worse than when he came in you&#39;re going to say it&#39;s better cuz he told you so well it&#39;s not better worse then it ever has been
4122,Not only is he a shity president the worst one in my lifetime he&#39;s not even a good human being and the people who follow him are no good to they act like they&#39;re above the virus while they&#39;re dying.

4127,The USA has been in chaos for the past 4 years. We can no longer go on this way. Remember what Nikita Khrushchev said that they will distroy the USA from the inside.  They will not lift a finger. We will do it ourselves. Is this what we are seeing today ? Is Khrushchev prediction coming true ?
4128,"Vote Libertarian if they put somebody else on the ballot, or vote Megatron... I don&#39;t care. Just... everybody vote for SOMEBODY ELSE"
4129,"Biden has a tendency to attack opponent before answering the question, i.e., &quot;the difference is millionaire and billionaire like him...,&quot; instead of focusing on answering the question directly about the &quot;K shape&quot; recovery and we, the public, would never know what the &quot;K shape&quot; recovery is.   Perhaps, it is better to focus on answering the questions directly to be a better and more effective speaker.  The issue of Biden&#39;s sons should not even be discussed because this is not a trial about his sons, so one has to be careful about answering these so-called &quot;baits&quot; questions which cause us to be sidetracked."
4130,Did he really just almost say we have the lowest carbon footprint? What?!??
4131,"i think for debates like this, the mediator should be able to turn on/off the canidates&#39; microphones cus they seem to be talking over each other A LOT lol"

4138,Biden bashes trump about things out of his power. The democratic state leaders are destroying their states to make trump look bad and trump cant intervine because its the states choice. Its not all trump. The governers of these states are choosing to let things go bad.
4139,Who else is pumped up for the final debate tonight üòÇ ü§£

4141,"Trump is a serious Joke, gl america"
4142,Im so scared for the election. IMO its gonna be bad whoever wins in terms of violence with potentialy more protests because people are going to be pisssd no matter who wins. All Im hoping is we make it past this year. I just want to be able to play as Rambo in Mortal Kombat on Nov. 17.
4143,"So much for open discussion, that first segment was a train wreck from the moderator"
4144,Trump dominated this debate. On a human level.
4145,fuck trump like ƒ± dont get how anyone can be that dumb
4146,...and that was the end of Chris Wallace‚Äôs career as a TV news anchor.
4147,I think this kind debate program should start in India
4148,Idk both seem kinda sus

4150,did you use the word SMART!!!!
4151,American Reality TV at your doorstep.
4152,Why does Biden not look at Trump?

4156,Hey joe your brown shirts have started so much shit
4157,Joe bidens friend was a grand wizard of the kkk. I saw him at that loosers funeral.  Dems started the kkk and didnt want the 13th amendment.
4158,Critical race theory is so racist. Soooo bad.

All of it is shit.  It cannot be fixed.  Burn it all down."
4161,Why do we watch these things? This whole 2 hours can be summed up..... Two old guys arguing and talking over each other and not answering any of the questions Americans want answered.
4162,Keep giggling joe. My friend died from covid. You will flush this country down the tube. Ill never vote for another dem ever. Ill do push ups against any day.

4166,Hwan on the 5 love jo biden and actually thinks creepy joe won this. Idiot
4167,Stay strong americans .I hope you can save your country from the virus and from trump  Blessing from a german .
4168,"I&#39;m not an American  ( i&#39;m half french half german )but this debate was horrifying. Trump continues to interupt  him. Biden interrupted him too only because he had to fight back and because trump doesn&#39;t stop talking. This was painful to watch<br>i don&#39;t understand how americans voted for trump ( he keeps lying to them, insult everyone deflects blame <br>towards others, ) But that not the worst part . (To me at least) he shook hands with dictators ( poutine , north Korea) treathning to destroy the alliance between america and Europe. Left the Paris accord ( because let&#39;s face it he didn&#39;t believe  climate change) <br>And Now he is threating the american democracy by saying to extremist stand by.  I  know next to nothing about Joe biden but i know this : he is a democrat , he was the vice-president of america , and was never accused for being incompetent. He also doesn&#39;t insult or lie ( not to my knowledge at least). <br>So yeah Biden is pretty much an improvement compared to trump.<br><br>America as global superpower may well be over because of trump and we all know that the ambitious Xi would jump at the opportunity to become the first superpower in the world ( which is scary considering that China is not a democracy . Not offense to the people of China)"

4173,"there needs to be shift and a change in the next debate, like not a biased af moderater."
4174,Trumps a fucking weirdo
4175,anybody else think that blaming a sitting president about a pandemic is wrong???? and then filter it with recession and racial tension...racial tension will always be ...has been and still is...American cant legislate racism....a recession caused by something uncountable but yet the economy is coming back fast....and for covid....nobody should blame somebody for those deaths....that&#39;s dead wrong....any other president would of had deaths....and that&#39;s if these numbers they telling us is even accurate....at the end of the day....when u blame a sitting president for a pandemic and charge them with those deaths is wrong...and thats Biden and Democrats main talking point...that&#39;s sad...they dont even explain how they would of done different and thats because everything trump did they would of done but they cant say that bcuzz they disagreed with every action trump did in the beginning.....so to me that looks like manipulation on the Democrats side...theres slot of switch and bait on the left and the people who pay attention see it
4176,John McAfee for president

4179,for those saying this is comedy never seen a debate nor have seen or read about other presidential debates...this is real politics...the problem is social media not the debate...in this presidential election we have both accusing the other of misconduct...this has happened before but not recently...our job as citizens is 2 divide the truth from falsehood and it looks like Trump does it very well...this is why many people support him....many may not agree with his ways but he has got the job done and for Biden...its pretty clear...he has no plans...his talking point is covid and riots...and none of that should be blamed on current admin
4180,"That dude is so dumb, how to blame a person about covid. The people to blame are the people that think this covid is a joke and act irresponsible then got sick, there people that even did covid parties and how can some one say it&#39;s the President fault that&#39;s ridiculous and ignorant."
4181,Joe you are environmental wacko
4182,He was asked twice for the supreme court and twice he started to talk about something else. The world will take advantage of that man if he wins. He can&#39;t even answer the question. I am sorry but I can&#39;t have a leader like that I hope people make the right decision and not just vote because famous people asked you to do so.
4183,In my opinion I don&#39;t think either Joe Biden or Donald Trump have what it takes to be a president. Donald Trump is in no way at all president material as for Joe Biden I don&#39;t believe that he is either president material but Joe Biden is better then Donald Trump in many ways. Donald Trump got Covid19 most likely because he did not wear a mask. I agree with Joe Biden on wearing masks and Covid19. I know many people that have died due to Covid19. Who Knows even if there will be a vaccine for Covid19. Joe Biden made many points but I disagree with some of them. Donald Trump is saying we don&#39;t need masks. They might not work but its not like we know at this point we need to were them even if they don&#39;t work we don&#39;t even know. I personally would not vote but if I had to I would vote for Joe Biden
4184,What a joke. Those 2 are worse than Eddie and Richie when they argue. <br>Trump is Richie and Biden is Eddie.... &quot;Shut up Richie&quot;

4200,Trump actively supports the all mighty dollar more than he does his own people
4201,"Since Trump does not know how to play fair,  it is vitally essential that he be muted when it&#39;s not his turn."
4202,So joe Biden interrupted president Trump  first
4203,They talk like they giving the stats like <br>Biden: 15% safety boost 500 health boost 10% economic growth <br>Trump: 20% economic boost<br><br><br><br><br>Which one would you equip
4204,No Trump He smart thats why Biden crowds are smaller
4205,keep your mask on Mr. Biden Dont pay Mr golden yellow face no mind lol
4206,Joe Biden is senile and is not fit to be president
4207,I think we should of shut down

4209,Moms feel like the moderator when their kids are arguein over a toy üò´
4210,This wasn‚Äôt even a debate: it was a classic among us discussion between how trump blamed Biden on thinking Sanders was a imposter or maybe both Biden and sanders where imposters <br>Also a bit weird how YouTube still has this on
4211,Did anyone hear Trump say to Biden that &quot; The blood is not in you&quot;?
4212,Calling him ‚Äújoe‚Äù is very disrespectful. Trump is old enough to know that it is impolite for people who are not friends and don‚Äôt know each other in any kind of social sense to call others by their first name.
4213,Lol ‚Äú Will you just shut up man‚Äù LOL I don‚Äôt think you can say that in a debate.

4228,We all wear masks why isn&#39;t everyone there required. Duh?
4229,This is probably the most views c-span has ever had
4230,OMG for real? I know it says Presidential Debate but isn&#39;t this supposed to be political as well so it can at least be considered a intellectual debate? Trump ain&#39;t a fucking politician why the fuck would anybody listen to him talk about shit he don&#39;t know. That&#39;s just stupid. If you&#39;re gonna vote Republican at least do it right and put someone who knows what the fuck they&#39;re doing in Charge. There is the speech Biden should have wrote. This is not politics it&#39;s a fucking joke.
4231,Should we just elect the moderator?
4232,"In the beginning it should have said: caution extreme interrupting, and it will make u go crazy.üòÇ"
4233,"Screw trump, go biden!"

4235,Trump: 47 years and you have done nothing. Pay attention people.
4236,"Actually, and this is the only thing I can say anything about from the debate, In Norway many believe that masks will enhance the risk of getting COVID due to us touching our face more often than usual because we have to fix or correct the mask. Also, some sources in Norway say that the COVID bacteria is not stopped by any fabric material, but by a special mask that&#39;s hard to get for any regular customer. I think I saw Kim Kardashian wear one. I, myself, use a regular mask to warn people from moving closer to me because there are FOR REAL no one that keeps their distance (I move like a ball in a pin-ball machine to avoid people that&#39;s passing me), but I believe that using a mask can make people remember they should stay away. And of course avoid any spit or snot of mine finding it&#39;s way towards others. However... When I use a mask, I get all these strange looks, and I&#39;ve only seen ONE other person use a mask in public! ONE! It&#39;s actually frowned upon some places. It&#39;s so freaking weird to recieve these looks. I do believe in using a mask as long as one does not touch the mask or face! And of course remove the mask properly and dispose, or wash, when done with it. <br><br>I am not an American, I just want to enlighten others to what goes on in other countries. Maybe someone could enlighten the Norwegians? As long as the mask is properly handled I think it&#39;s very smart to use it, but not if the mask is not handled properly. Where is the &quot;How to use a mask&quot; information commercial?"

4243,I don&#39;t like Trump but Joe Biden would make an even worse president. He&#39;s senile and can&#39;t even speak in sentence. Your 401K plans are going to go down under him big time. He&#39;s too much of a socialist for me. His son Hunter is a total scumbag. I&#39;m voting for Jo Jorgensen the Libertarian candate on the ballot. She&#39;s better than both of them. Even if she doesn&#39;t win I know in my heart I voted for the best person for the job no matter the outcome and I don&#39;t care if people say its a wasted vote. A wasted vote is voting for Biden not because you like him but because you hate Trump.
4244,Biden is obviously our best option.

4261,wow someone needs to make a talking stick apparently...but again that wont change trump from acting like the spoiled child he is and wont teach him manners or how to act like an adult let alone the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES instead of talking trash and telling us what you will do how about you tell us what you have done and what your plans are because you didn&#39;t do what you could have or should have with covid-19. every country should have been a way to learn what to do and what not to do but I guess you just choose doing nothing was better...nothing will change until everything changes and I don&#39;t see that happening anytime soon we need younger politicians who live everyday impacted by the problems at hand and can focus on the now and our future. these campaigns have become bullying adds instead of telling us what your going to do to better this country and what specifically your going to do for each state to deserve our votes as well as what your going to do to help this country be safe and help rebuild our economy.

4284,"I hated this circus the first time I watched it but watching it again, I find it interesting that President Trump was noted for his interruptions. He clearly did not join in the fray until after Joe and the Moderator had already interrupted him many times and cut what he was saying short. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=1830"">30:30</a>-President Trump given 2 minutes to talk about Supreme Court Appointment. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=1910"">31:50</a> President Trump finishes ten seconds early. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=1916"">31:56</a> Joe Biden starts his rebuttal. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2043"">34:03</a> Joe Biden finishes (slightly past time). Trump starts talking immediately in rebuttal to that (which is standard for debates I have seen in person and on television). <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2069"">34:29</a> Joe Biden interrupts Trump. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2079"">34:39</a> Joe Biden interrupts Trump. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2092"">34:52</a> Joe Biden interrupts Trump. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2096"">34:56</a> Moderator interrupts Trump (and another one of Biden&#39;s interruptions) to tell them they are in &quot;open discussion&quot; (a new concept for this debate based on all the past presidential debates I have watched). The Moderator gives Biden permission to keep speaking (despite the fact Trump was in the middle of responding to one of Biden&#39;s asides and Trump has spent less than a minute responding and was interrupted three times). <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2100"">35:00</a> Joe Biden begins talking. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2128"">35:28</a> Trump interrupts Biden. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2144"">35:44</a> Trump interrupts Biden. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2167"">36:07</a> Trump interrupts Biden and takes floor after Joe asks question-Joe has had a full minute to speak with three Trump interruptions. 36.14 Joe interrupts and continues interrupting until <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2185"">36:25</a>. The Moderator interrupts Trump at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2188"">36:28</a>. Biden and the Moderator both continue interrupting with Biden finally telling Trump to &quot;shut-up&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2194"">36:34</a>. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2199"">36:39</a>, the Moderator stops Trump from talking and again turns it over to Biden despite the fact Trump was responding to something Biden interrupted with. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2213"">36:53</a> Trump interrupts with a question to Biden. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2227"">37:07</a> Biden admits he doesn&#39;t know the nominated Justice&#39;s view on Roe v Wade despite making claims she is anti-Row v Wade. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2228"">37:08</a> The Moderator interrupts Biden and Trump and concludes the topic. <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2277"">37:57</a> Moderator says Trump has never come up with a replacement plan (which even I know he has-here is a blog post from someone talking about it right after the 2016 election: <a href=""https://www.naylornetwork.com/cmsatoday/articles/index-v3.asp?aid=411290&amp;issueID=53655)"">https://www.naylornetwork.com/cmsatoday/articles/index-v3.asp?aid=411290&amp;issueID=53655)</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2302"">38:22</a> The Moderator prevents Trump from stating he has a plan--and re-asks the question stating Trump has not come up with a plan! Dude, if you are going to Moderate and ask questions, (1) You cannot always give the floor to Biden; (2) You should ask questions that are politically NEUTRAL and that can be asked to BOTH candidates WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT REWORDING (i.e. a good Moderator would have said &quot;What is your plan for Healthcare over the next 4 years?&quot;) (3) A good Moderator should at least do some research. <br><br>At this point, I feel confirmed in my original opinion that this was not a real debate but a staged Democratic party political ploy, and although I have voted for Democrats in years past and am not sure I will vote for Trump this year (something I wouldn&#39;t have even considered in the Spring), I am definitely sure that I am not going to vote for a single Democrat because they are stifling free speech and not letting the public see both sides. The first amendment says that everyone is allowed to share their opinions, but the Democrats want to put a mute button on Trump. Why? If Democrats have the best party and the best platform, they would let people hear what Trump has to say so the people can decide. You want a fair debate, you shut off the opposing person and the Moderator&#39;s mics for two minutes while each person is talking, and you don&#39;t have an open free-for-all where Democrat candidates can interrupt without censure but Republican candidates cannot. You choose questions you can ask both parties about their policies not politically heated, one-sided hot-points. Done watching this one and won&#39;t watch anymore, nor will I blame President Trump if he refuses to debate."

4286,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇoh lord none of these 2 candidates are SHIT!! im laughinggg hard at how they discuss each other lol
4287,"Giving this a 2nd watch, Trump undoubtedly won this"
4288,"I&#39;m not American. I made sticky notes to watch it since the debate took place. So... Let&#39;s all assume that the vast majority of citizens know that every president or maybe better said, every candidate puts the accent on certain things in different measures (healthcare, economy, justice..). Despite this, in theory, a man in this position shouldn&#39;t have weak points, in reality, no one has a perfect view of anything. I will happily accept that both Trump and Bidden are right and wrong in various matters, but I (and probably everyone) simply can&#39;t accept that a presidential debate should go like this. They are speaking badly with each other but most importantly, they attack the person. &quot;liar&quot;, &quot;clown&quot;, &quot;just shut up man&quot;, &quot;you can&#39;t talk to me with the word &quot;smart&quot; because you graduated in x college in x position&quot;.. Excuse me? Are we grown-ups or what? The questions were good. I hardly pitied the moderator. The poor man shouted &quot;Mr (vice)president&quot; or &quot;gentlemen&quot; like 100 times. It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true. It&#39;s funny but it&#39;s undoubtedly sad."

I can tell Biden is more calm and collected and shrugs off Trump nicely by laughing off his insults and putting him in his place. I can see a glimpse of compassion in him as well. Trump is more arrogant, loud, judgmental, incessantly interrupts and talks over people, and thinks he knows everything about bringing peace to America. He literally doesn&#39;t think he has any flaws in his character. <br><br>Trump assumes there is nothing smart about Biden. Biden probably knows more than he says. Who is Trump to tell who is smart and who&#39;s not. In 47 years, Biden probably gained a lot of experience in politics whereas trump hasn&#39;t done much to help build America up during the 4 years of his presidency.

Without much if any substance or things to prove past success (and he was in politics for much longer..) doing what he claims.<br><br>B<br><br>Biden is blaming violence and weaker economy on trump.<br><br>Well, look at the facts.<br><br>It was a democrat party which supported blm, which included much much violence and chaos, the news actually showing much of this.<br><br>Consistently on videos, democrats are seen attacking, even physically anyone who simply shows they are a trump supporter. <br>A democracy, I would think would actually support two parties and consideration of both sides, respectfully, and, obviously without violence.<br><br>Economy?<br>It is due to a shutdown which he and the party he&#39;s supposed to represent were and are urging it to be done. <br>But trump is the president, the one who advocates lessoning of a complete shutdown, so they are wrongfully blaming him for their own advocated policies.<br><br>Again, he keeps on making promises, and talking as though he&#39;s speaking for the American people, saying simply saying whatever he thinks they would want to hear.<br><br>Now people are worried about the President refusing to step down right?<br><br>Well, since the President was elected, it is his side which were and continue to not accept him as President.

4535,EXCELLENT
4536,"The statement of Biden on the segment &quot;How confident are you that this will be a fair election?&quot;<br>Is comforting. You could actually feel the empathy and his concern to the nation almost everytime he speaks. He was just overwhelmed by a constant interuption of Mr. Trump. Yes, he&#39;s not perfect but I rather choose him than a leader who is ego-centric and always tend to sugar coat the mistakes rather than thinking how to fix it and implement solutions for a better change. At the end of the day, a sign of a true leader is a good listener and has a heart to lay down his life to his nation."

4548,Weak moderator. Ruined this opportunity
4549,We are all doomed
4550,"People keep commenting that its trump vs biden and the moderator. Does it ever occur to them that this is trump versus reality? The moderator is not bias, they have to interject to keep information accurate, and airtime fair both of which are in public interest. If trump violates those principles more, I am sure to his fans the moderator seems &quot;biased&quot;. But your issue is with the moderator attempting to keep the debate on course when your issue should be with trump trying to derail it. He gets nervous and impulsive every time Biden is making a valid criticism or academically informed point. So he squirms and interrupts. Trump couldn&#39;t win a debate in which he was allowed to interrupt and a Fox (i.e. republican) moderated. Good luck debating next week with the new debate rules including muted microphones donald. Congratulations, your campaign is in the toilet."

4556,"Trump is just a manipulator. The first words that came out were bs and that‚Äôs scary. He receives information from every and any  source then tries to shove that information in his own words to people to make them feel like their wanted , to get into their heads. Once he‚Äôs in your head then he‚Äôs in your heart once he‚Äôs in your heart then he‚Äôs in your feelings; You start to feel good about him because you think he has been and will be a great president and now you feel like he cares. News flash baby he don‚Äôt give a fuck and he even said that so my loves neither should you. And I feel like joe is trying to speak for the people because he knows people are fed up he actually wants to make a change. Trump is just beating  around the bush. Joe was right trump has done nothing  these past 4 years but talk shit. If he actually wanted to make a change he would‚Äôve if he wanted to make things better he would‚Äôve. Trump is saying random things that have nothing to do with this debate, nothing about corona, nothing about the Supreme Court and nothing about the economy. He cares about nothing but himself and we see that everyday buttttttt He‚Äôs just a good shit talker that people cling to. It‚Äôs time WAKE TF UP GUYSSS!!!!!"

4570,I&#39;d say Trump won this one regardless.. bottom line.. Biden wants to shut down everything without fully considering the wide scale ramifications of doing so.. now that we are more familiar with how COVID and realize it&#39;s not as dangerous as first expected.. there is no longer justification for the shutdown the world is going through..

4715,"Independent: Trump Won this debate and Kamala won against Mike! Total confusion. My Vote for Trump is when He truthfully said democrats got pissed at him for stopping people with covid from coming here and Yes, individual mandate on healthcare is unconstitutional, because it allows a martial law like system. The only way Joe will pull off a win is with free college education, free healthcare and placing a cap price on clothing, Mortgage/Rent and Auto industry.  Otherwise it&#39;s pointless. I don&#39;t want to see rich people get taxed harder because then they gone hire machines to do the job, and this will prevent new businesses from growing, I dont wanna see mandates on healthcare it allows for implantable micro chips, and I don&#39;t care about Russia nor China&#39;s or Foreign economy."
4716,Its sad but seems like Trump is just having fun toying with Biden.    However because its kinda obvious Bidens head is not in the game its like he doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on . no  game plan and he can&#39;t answer the debaters question at all .   Trump is simply on a much higher level .   I dnt think Biden is a bad person but i believe Democrats would want Biden elected just because he would be a yes man and allow who ever to make the decisions.

Consider Trump vs Biden.<br><br>¬†Both sides said the other was the devil. The truth? Both sides are right, at least on this one. Trump vs Biden brings up something else: how can I possibly be motivated to get out and vote if doing so means facing choices like THIS?Politics is just a whole lot of nastiness.¬†<br><br>People argue over it. People fight over it. Friendships are broken over it. Family members stop speaking to each other over it. Is this REALLY something you WANT to be involved with? I mean, the world is nasty and divisive enough as it is.¬†Who is REALLY ‚Äòright‚Äô?¬†<br><br>Both sides say their way is the ONLY way, and the other side is bad. But all in all, the economy can go bad with either side in power. Wars start with either side in power.¬†<br><br>Nobody REALLY seems to be able to get things right. Both sides just look like a bunch of incompetent fools who only THINK they are right. Meanwhile, they enjoy blaming EVERYTHING on the other side when things go wrong.¬†Too dogmatic.¬†<br><br>Both politicians and highly political folks put party rules and conventions above all else. Common sense and practicality mean NOTHING. Why would I want to partake in a system that puts party above common sense and (most of all) the people?¬†Too negative. Politics is all about making the other side look bad.¬†<br><br>Politicians spend VAST amounts of time and energy to do so. And negative campaigning has been the rule forever. The world is negative enough. Do we REALLY need to make things worse.¬†<br><br>Disinterest. There are MANY other things that interest me FAR more than politics.¬†It doesn‚Äôt really affect me. Neither side is going to do anything that will TRULY improve the life of the average person. Furthermore, there are other pursuits that benefit me FAR more than politics."

Not just the ones on top but maybe the one in the middle maybe the ones who are feeling hopeless maybe the property victims of circumstances we all should to be our better selves that just my thoughts
4846,if you dont beleive in trump and the fake news watch the movie &quot;Our brand is Chaos&quot; read between the lines instead of saying what is . He is trying to sued people into believing he is their hope!
4847,Orange sus
4848,"Joe Biden is bull crap he is a well known racist, trump is actually trying no doubt, he look out for the black communities and not only the black but others know your history american BTW am Jamaican.......47 years in politics and Joe Biden done nothing he is a racist against the black communities i rather vote and give trump another chance than this bull crap Joe Biden"
4849,I fucking hate Trump but when he said &quot;China ate ur lunch Joe&quot; I DIEDDDD I FELL ON THE FLOOR LAUGHING
4850,Pence and Harris moderator should do it
4851,Trump is out of control
4852,Chris handled this terribly up front debating POTUS and not allowing Biden to. He&#39;s protecting Biden because they hold the same views. Chris was not the right man for this job
4853,"Joe&#39;s a fkn billionaire off of OUR BACKS!!! Trump is one of US because he&#39;s not a sleezy politician lining his pockets with ppl less fortunate. His silver spoon came from his family then his work ethic Joe&#39;s came from the American peoples taxes, trust and sacrifice. Joe is a fkn weasel"
4854,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;t=2761"">46:01</a> why does Biden say &quot;good luck&quot; before saying anything else? He had no reason to say it. Weird."

4859,"https://youtu.be/o1AZON6ZsQc<br>If you want truth view video. Copy and paste watch and listen to it all before making mind up.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIjaLmOTkEE"">https://youtu.be/nIjaLmOTkEE</a><br>Wake up America do you want corruption in White House of money laundering, sex trafficking, pay offs you love ones killed and cover up like Barisma and pay offs Biden‚Äôs got there are documents out there in the <a href=""http://senate.gov/"">senate.gov/</a> emails in there own words as well as charges. But they don‚Äôt want you to know this. There hiding the truth do you don‚Äôt see this and removed the site that had paperwork on it except I copied down so people will know.  The truth and we‚Äôre to find it. Go to : <br><a href=""http://rudyscommensence.com/"">rudyscommensence.com</a>  <br>This site is Giuliani and he has all the truth on his documents on their web page so you can see them directly with Giuliani. If you don‚Äôt believe me go to <a href=""http://blazingpress.com/"">blazingpress.com</a> look for their website for Giuliani their video clip that they had and it tells you exactly detailing this, in there own words Hunter and Biden emails , to where to go on the site and you can see all the emails and everything that they had on there that Biden and Hunter said and they‚Äôre covering pay offs to whole family as well as to Hunter and Biden on China, Russia and two other countries. On millions. Its all up and their trying to hide it so you don‚Äôt see it.  Let the truth be know! I cannot hide what millions have seen already but the video clips the people have not seen they are deleting them but the only thing is if you take a snapshot showing the site where people can go and look for it helps because I can‚Äôt erase the Snapchat‚Äòs. These webpages that I‚Äôve posted have seen by millions of people already and they cannot erase them. My suggestion is that you go and search them out and see for yourself with your own eyes. I don‚Äôt want a president in there that‚Äôs going to be lying to me that‚Äôs taking money and payback‚Äôs. And covering up the truth because they‚Äôre getting paid off and they got paid off more than burgers and I believe me because it‚Äôs all in the documents and their emails in your own words. Giuliani I‚Äôm his webpage has the documents that came off of a hard drive of Hunter Bidens. Hunter took his laptop and they get it corrected because he was having a problem with it or on it on the hard drive they found corruption and they turned it in to the law and they took it from there. That‚Äôs how He got caught and his father is trying to cover up his errors I did Niang it and lying about it when they‚Äôve got them already that he lied to the American people right on video. You guys are all being lied to when he says he does not know the truth about this he does he was fully aware of the situation. Because it talks about who the players are in all these emails and it tells how much people that paid off even they hasn‚Äôt even the Joe Biden‚Äòs brother is in there and one of the deals as well as his family and the Army there‚Äôs a letter they are directly from Hunter to Naomi telling it all. I don‚Äôt care which way you guys vote all I do is want to tell the truth and let the truth be out there so you guys know the truth and not for it to be covered up like they‚Äôre trying to do and pulling the sites. But like I said these websites that are on here they‚Äôve been seen by millions of people because he cites one of them is a very Christian site and has been seen by many of Christians across the country so people can go out there and look at it for themselves. Instead of reporting and half the truth This is the truth."
4860,"The debate mention of the idea of ANTIFA, merely meaning anti-fascism is a propagandized idea with the goal of blaming those whom elitists wish to rid themselves of because we are becoming a greed based problem. <br>When a people, A NATION of people, cannot survive their is a natural reaction. ANTIFA is merely the natural reaction of survival.  When you control the nations riches, it‚Äôs money, it‚Äôs means of survival, you control people‚Äôs reactions and beliefs.  And so this becomes the elitism last resort to invest in - humanity.  We can‚Äôt have the concept of fascism, when a nations poor lower middle to lower classes keep getting poorer.  This is an oxymoron unless the plans are set to turn a Constitutional nation and turn into a private nation, an aristocracy. <br>The fascism is an ‚Äúanything goes concept‚Äù void of any form of governing body. It aims to take advantage of and intimidate impoverished segments of that nation‚Äôs poor, needy, its perceived, undesirable and demonize them and then bring them out into the streets, blame them and assassinate them. This has the potential of becoming a new modern day holocaust. <br>This is the Confederacy rising up again. It‚Äôs a private nation refusing to become a Constitutional nation. An example of ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù is slavery and how fascism evolves to survival of the fittest style, predatorial society.     This leads to Christianity and Religion traditionally falling into persecution. <br>Republicans know one thing MONEY and GREED as the CORE governing concept. This is simply put corruption and decay as its end result, and even an occult concept.     University political science professors, influential representatives need to step up and educate the public now, clout and influence is needed before ignorance follows this path even further. <br>These concepts are built into the pathos of Trump and the party‚Äôs political wants. Elitism is what makes him and many like him pathologically inclined and empty hearted. <br>This is Satan‚Äôs Pathos, the money root of all evil, riches rots a man‚Äôs heart and leaves a nations needy out to survive and fend for themselves. <br>Fascism runs in Trump‚Äôs vains without him even knowing it‚Äôs meaning and ideology. It is pathological greed AT ANY COST...you and I in the millions amounts to they‚Äôre survival. This is the beginnings of a modern holocaust."

As soon as the interval is used up, the microphone goeto vice Presidents dead, and the opposing debater&#39;s microphone is opened. Period !!! Let this suggestion go viral. Please !!   One important benefit of this is, to keep moderator bias out of the debate."
4935,"When you have candidates like that on both side... and people are wondering whether this is a debate or a parody. the political climate is a joke... a rigged contest. where in 2020 we no longer need to vote for representative we have the technologies to represent our-self, you want real democracy don&#39;t vote for people that share mostly you idea. vote directly for your idea, cut the middle man. change the political system. read book and study be well informed, i suggest you all take a look at &quot;Utopia for realist and how to get there&quot;. it explain why most idea that recent presidents have been pushing are counter productive to the goal sold us. just to be clear this &quot;Debate&quot; is a complete joke..."

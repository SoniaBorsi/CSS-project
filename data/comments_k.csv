1,We got this now Kamala 2024 woooooo hoooook
2,TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT FOREVER!!!!
3,Kamala Harris will not withstand the public scrutiny going all the way back to back Her indiscretions with Willie Brown Who gave her two political appointments for her shall we say favors not to mention her absolute inability to grasp any serious concepts and speak on anything with any conviction. This is going to be hilarious. But I really don&#39;t think Democratic donors are gonna put their weight behind her so it&#39;s probably a non issue
4,She is not going to win!!
5,Trump old and out dated
6,Where do you get these Democratic Strategists????? Very detached from Reality
7,Do better America.
8,From 0%-100% ....what chance does Kamala have to win the Presidential election?
9,Biden to Harris....from the fat into the fire.<br>US politics is bizarre to the Nth degree.<br>It has now become an open door for Trump.
10,Shes unlikable like Hilary

12,Who needs old men who think Airports were in 1776
13,America won&#39;t have any borders left.
14,Young young Kamala is old too🤡🤡🤡 she’s she’s like in her late 50s that’s not young at all either btw
15,She will be what she can be...having been burdened by what has been. Then we will all be what we can be when being unburden by what has been...when it was and when it will be after being what was once been what it has been...
16,This is what all those Black Female superhero video games and movies was getting us ready for.
17,The only strong thing about harris is her breathe and her odor. Trump 2024
18,"Vice President Kamala Harris should from now on, do all President issues, so they are common and can imagine that vice is not anymore. She is from now on till november President and after that, too. She is the right choice, she should visit now all leaders in world. To be be active now as a President. So President Joe Biden should step back from now on and let the thunder and the glamour shine on Kamala Harris. God Bless America. 🇺🇸"
19,There’s many canadiates in the Republican Party the democrat party has bunch of old goons if kamala steps down too
20,Bob Marley Convention 🎵 song
21,Nothing could be better for the Trump campaign than a Harris run at the presidency!
22,She will become the president who’s locked up the most Black people in history
23,worst choice ever 😂 She&#39;s in charge of the border its a good indicator of her incompetence
24,Not the hackling liar 🤥🤣🤣🤣
25,Not your body
26,😂😂😂😂😂 welp
27,She is from Jamaica Mon
28,The second woman Trump beats
29,"Trump is now the only rich, white, out of touch, old candidate 😅"
30,"Younger than Biden or trump, nobody can complain about age. She&#39;s GOTTA BEAT #45, or we&#39;re DOOMED as Americans"
31,She will rip trump to sreds she is a good prosecuting attorney and way way smarter than trump
32,Trump going to win easy work
33,No!! Please no Kamala!! She’s not stable!!😂
34,She got smoked by Tulsi
35,The Democrat coup is allllmost complete.  Talk about a threat to democracy.....
36,She is incompetent at all.
37,"Na, that video of Tulsi gabbard destroyed her chances."
38,hahaha some lol
39,Time for someone young. Trump is too old.
40,I will admit that after everything in the past few days it seems like trump has an extremely high chance of winning this election with most of the favorability going to him. As a republican and trump supporter I would want trump to win because of the great qualities and opportunities for the nation that he brings to the table. I’m glad the Joe Biden finally stepped down because it was obvious that he was not fit for another four years in office. Now thankfully his VP is the democratic nominee for president and she seems fit for the presidency as well although at this point I don’t believe she will win but possibly in the future since she seems favorable to most people.
41,We had no primary so i already decided not to vote.  It doesn&#39;t matter if joe stepped aside. Its too late.
42,"Wow, so even the WSJ is already campaigning for Harris now with this political a--I mean news video."
43,"One more presidential debate in the near the horizon, right? Let&#39;s see how Kamala fare against Trump. One can then decide whether Democrats should refocus for 2028 presidential election."
44,"Only a few days ago, Biden still insisted that he was the best qualified person to be the president and the best to defeat Trump. Now she is! She did not get far in 2020. She was picked up for VP purely because of her color and gender. Period."
45,Kamala the joke
46,White America &gt; everything else
47,Kamala 😂. Kamala running for president 😂
48,She won’t even be the nominee.
49,Who edited this video? 🗑️
50,Black voters should have learnt their lesson by now….
51,This could be concerning.<br>The many that will not vote for Joe may vote for her…<br>People vote with their hearts not their minds…
52,"She has the audacity to say Trump doesn&#39;t have the character to be President??  Ask the then married S.F. Mayor, Willie Brown, about Kamala&#39;s &#39;good character&#39;, LOL!  Not good character you can brag about, Kamala...."
53,Trump already won.
54,Give me a break
55,A vote for Harris is a vote against Project 2025.
56,"She doesn&#39;t appear to have the experience. She&#39;s, dare I say, far too young in the eyes of most voters. Regardless of her reality; those perceptions will hurt her at the poll."
57,Harris laugh is so weird
58,🤣🤣🤣🤣
59,"I&#39;m disappointed at how many doubters there are. I know a lot of people hate Kamala. I admit, I probably haven&#39;t seen her speak as much as those people, but what I do know, is she will be able to speak coherently, and hopefully be able to actually talk back to Trump in a debate environment. Assuming she&#39;s the nominee. I feel nothing but relief that it isn&#39;t entirely resting on Biden now. Even if it&#39;s a slim chance, at least we&#39;ll have someone who doesn&#39;t freeze up on stage."
60,God bless President Biden! And God bless the next democratic nominee and president of the United States of America!!!
61,"Another fake news bias report by Wall street Jouranal. Hey why don&#39;t you guys do a report about related hedge firm Blackrock trying to short their Donald Trump stock a day before the hit and told the SEC to unlisted it day later on their filings site when people found out , oh yeah , I forgot , your fake news !!!"
62,I would LOVE to see Joey&#39;s face when he&#39;s finally told he dropped out of the race earlier today.
63,"No thank you, for Harris. We need a stronger candidate!"
64,😂😂😂😂😂 are you kidding me? I want what you’re smoking!
65,I saw on the Simpson she is the President and they are all ways right 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
66,laughable. NO she is worse than Biden as if that was possible!
67,"Kamala knows what can be, unburdened By what has been..."
68,"Bruh, she couldn&#39;t even win the primary for her own party. How is she gonna win the election?? Not gonna happen"
69,"Please someone name ONE thing that KH achieved as VP USA...I hear crickets...ZIP...NIL...ZERO - Oh, OPEN BORDER CZAR!!"
70,Kamala WHO?????  Trump2024<br>Trump has my vote
71,No chnace at all
72,She is a joke an will lose 100 %
73,Harris isn&#39;t Obama  especially with their disastrous first term.

75,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=186"">3:06</a> my man said young lol she&#39;s 60"
76,She was always last in the presidential debates.  Her polls numbers have always been much lower than Biden&#39;s.  She had one job to secure the boarder and has never been there.
77,NO
78,Let’s watch the racists and misogynists come out in full force. I see you guys testing the waters with coded language. Just say exactly what you feel at your core.
79,I LOVE BIDEN HATE HARRIS - A DO NOTHING VP WHO A FEW WEEKS BACK THEY SAID SHE WAS A DRAG ON JOE -  A FEW SPEECH&#39;S ON ABORTION AND SHE IS BRILLIANT - NOT IN MY MIND. SHE WAS A TERRIBLE AG - CARED MORE ABOUT WINING THAN JUSTICE.  ONLY HAD 4 YEARS IN SENATE AND A 4 YEAR AS DO NOTHING VP.  THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP STINKS THEY TOOK MY VOTE AWAY JUST LIKE TRUMP TRIED TO DO ON JAM 6TH  AND THEIR CHAOS WAS WORSE THAN TRUMPS.  THE REPUBLICANS HANDED THEM A WINING TICKET  PROJECT 2025 - EVEN I COULD WIN.  PROJECT 2025 SEARCHES FROM JUNE 30 WENT OVER TAYLOR SWIFT SEARCHES WHEN MSNBC SHOWED IT THE EARLY PART OF JULY. -  WHY THE PUSH?   I GUESS THESE POLITICIANS CAN&#39;T SELL SO HOW DID THEY GET ELECTED.
80,Lol😂 Harris and Biden are like Dumb and Dumber.
81,She has absolutely no chance
82,"Quote &quot;how do you win the presidency if don&#39;t win the majority of white voters&quot;<br>Comment:<br>When a person has to specifically cater to certain voters because of her race, skin color, or gender, they cannot make objective and fair judgments about what policy is most beneficial for the country.<br><br>Trump has fewer external influences from other groups or people that would prevent him from doing what is best for the country."
83,Joe conveniently steps down just after Trump&#39;s assassination attempt..... Dry snitching if you ask me ... Now all the prefabricated propaganda starts rolling out talking about how Kamala is going to win..... Ooooookaaaaaayyyyyyyyy ... 🍿 Its a big friggin show and we are all fed the illusion of democracy
84,Jamaicans🇯🇲 would love to see Americans🇺🇸 invest more in Jamaica 🇯🇲 like bringing in a lot of  new companies so more people can get jobs in every field
85,"@Harris, what is a woman?"
86,Trump<br>2024
87,"&quot;Kamala, was that Willie Brown?&quot; &quot;Actually, it was closer to beige.&quot;"
88,Strong? Lol...😂😂😂😂😂
89,"I will NEVER forget how these networks, media outlets, pundits, donors and some Democratic leaders\Democrats browbeat, bullied, harassed and terrorized President Biden into not seeking re-election in 2024 because of his age.<br><br>They disregarded his OUTSTANDING record and stellar performance as POTUS while being silent re: his lowest of his low opponent, Donald Trump-a pathological liar, bully, convicted felon, textbook insurrectionist, civil sexual assaulter &amp; horrific human being.<br><br>My heart goes out to and is with President Biden. I stand with and will support Kamala Harris as the Presidential nominee, however, Trump and his cronies had better pray Michelle Obama doesn&#39;t come off of the bench. <br><br>VOTE BLUE!"
90,"She’s not strong at all, I feel like even democrats don’t like her like they did Joe"
91,Kamala will step into Joe&#39;s shoes she Will Win we want her and no I&#39;m not black shell  get the vote.
92,They literally so helpless the just playing the female card what a joke.
93,Let me put it to this way. Period whoever it is we’ll get my vote. The objective here is to keep Trump far far away and watch him fade off into the sunset until he does some act that gets him thrown into prison for good.
94,Kamala will stop the $500.00 hammers and cut this Military budget!
95,She only got 844 votes. People can’t stand her
96,I think that she would make a good candidate. I wish her all the best going forward!
97,Comparing Kamala Harris to Barrack Obama is an insult to Obama
98,"Let&#39;s be real, Joe Biden was a low bar to beat."
99,"However, Kamala is NOT Obama. Never will be.  The world has watched her bungle for 3 years. She got ZERO support during her own presidential run. She is known for sentences that make no sense. <br>Not a strong candidate…."
100,Ms. Giggles.
101,If Democrats want to win they need PA GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO AS PRESIDENT AND MARYLAND GOV. WESS MOORE AS VP PICK.
102,"How can she be a better candidate? She&#39;s younger than Biden, but using her repeated soundbites won&#39;t help her. She had people of color locked up in prison for minor crimes in California, stating they could be used as free labor. She lied for how many years, saying Biden was &quot;healthy&quot; and vibrantly aware. She panders to whomever she believes will give her power. She would never be in the Wall Street Journal if it had to do with business. She is not African-American. Dem delegates need to seriously reconsider putting someone else on the ticket now. RFK Jr getting more love than Harris"
103,meanwhile Kakala has never been to Europe. Willie did take her to Disney World that one time though
104,She is not in African American.Why don&#39;t you people look into that !!
105,She destroyed San Francisco and played jump rope with the border crisis. She also put millions in jail for marijuana and laughed about it
106,"I&#39;m Mexican living in Mexico and from the bottom of my heart I wish Americans vote Trump, he is the best option for our American amigos."
107,Kamala went to school in Canada...busing in California was a lie. She is not charismatic like Obama either. It&#39;s going to be worse than 2016.
108,Harris vs Trump⁉️🤣😂🤣
109,Kamala Harris should be highly desired by any Can Can dance companies in Paris.
110,If she is successfully able to  make Trump look like an old out of touch fossil with the mainstream voter and young voters then she will win. Her policy on abortion may also help her with women.
111,"harris isn&#39;t black !<br>abortion is still legal , it&#39;s the states that decide"
112,We still voting trump lol
113,Harris 2024!💙🇺🇸
114,13 percent of the population want to be 100%
115,"Ah-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. stronger? No. It&#39;s not Willy Brown who decides whether she wins or loses, so, she&#39;s going to LOSE."
116,"Anybody, even a dog would be &quot;A Stronger Candidate Against Trump&quot;"
117,And Kamala Harris doesn&#39;t the know-how to be even vice-president!!!
118,She needs to meet with TikTok/social media influencers to get her name &amp; policies out there to the youth!!!
119,One clown dropped out another running.  That&#39;s Hilarious 😂
120,"USA is not a land of the free anymore. A country divided by race, values, and religion. Future is either a civil war, or gradual loss of its civilisation through demographic change."
121,&quot; I went to bed and slept the sleep of the saved” <br>- winston churchill
122,Thank you president Biden for your decades of service and sacrifice.     You will go down in history as one of the greatest president of the modern era. AMERICA 🇺🇸 will miss your leadership. ❤️
123,Another 4 years of the orange conman &amp; his crooked family. No matter what else he has done i will never forgive his bonespurs bs. sorta like cassius clay and lou alcinder
124,The best man to beat Trump just step down. <br>Write in Biden
125,Where is Willie Brown?
126,"My Liberal Neighbors told us if Biden drops out, they will support Trump.  They said Cackling Harris is a joke."
127,This is hilarious
128,Definitely voting for Harris and telling all my family members to do so as well. God bless our future President Harris~
129,It&#39;s like the media is on someone payroll that knows exactly of what outcomes are going to take place in the polotical circles and are just &quot;waiting&quot; for the event to happen. Obvious much.
130,She is very weak candidate big mistakes
131,You are wrong <br>I’m not going to vote at all
132,"Don’t tell that she’s not African American,cylburn will be furious to find out Biden tricked him"
133,JC this will be funny... All the best KH
134,"🎉ENERGIZES the electorate, brings out more PROPLE to VOTE helping all the other races for a Democratic win and saving the 🇺🇸 from the fascist dictatorship of trump 👹"
135,Pick Michelle Obama for vice president.
136,The democrats and I hate to say this they set up Donald Trump to be shot. Ms. Harris  needs to take her presidency and sholve it. Trump  is winner
137,How could Trump&#39;s policies on abortion even matter now that it is all decided at the state level.  Learn some public civics.
138,Just subscribed because of how fast this was uploaded 😂
139,Kackling Kamala will be destroyed debating against Trump.<br>TRUMP 2024😊
140,Trump doesnt have policies on abortion and has stated he would not sign a federal abortion ban.
141,Kamala president the laughing president
142,She’s the worst.  🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
143,Voting for her is like voting for Biden. 🔥
144,He conveniently steps down after trump assassination attempt..... Dry snitching?
145,"yesssssss go kamala ... kamala, jasmine, and ledricka are best choices for president.. all strong smart brave leaders for our future"
146,She has nothing to prove... We are voting against the implementation of Project 2025..
147,She is totally unfit and unprepared to be commander in chief.
148,"Trump 2024, with the help of Kennedy 2024, will beat Harris!"
149,Still voting for trump/rfk 😂
150,This video was released at the same time when Joe Biden decided to give up. It was pre-recorded.
151,Kamala Harrison for president.  Liz Cheney for vice president !
152,The fact they used a question mark means it&#39;s bad
153,"Endorsing Kamala Harris as President, is like asking a first-grader to be a high school principal...not qualified."
154,No one likes Kamala. She can&#39;t even speak intelligently.
155,Kamala and Michelle Obama vice
156,Go Trump!
157,She will do fine..
158,We don’t want Harris come on…. Why do you guys not get it. You made the same mistake with Clinton. And I’m a black woman.
159,"Biden needed to stand down, when re-election was starting to happen."
160,"i wish that she wins but i don&#39;t think (as much as i disagree) that America is ready for a woman POTUS. it does not matter to me that she is a black/asian or from Mars, this country took until 1920 before they even gave women the right to vote"
161,"She&#39;s a great prosecutor?!  Sure, everyone knows how much Americans love lawyers.  Maybe slightly more popular than Michelle Obama with kids in school cafeterias."
162,"Joe Biden, didn&#39;t drop out he was outed by his party. Kamala, you don&#39;t have the character to be the President of the USA either. You have been a slacker as the VP."
163,So now Trump is the oldest candidate for president. He is too old.
164,Kamala is a kind person with a big heart. She cares about people. She was a<br>district attorney and has never been convicted of any felonies. I am so happy she <br>is in the race.
165,"Congratulations America and democracy, I can hear Republicans wiping from across the pond 😂"
166,Just get Michelle already
167,"Out of the 29 presidential candidates from the 2020 primaries, Harris was one of the least popular.... kind of scary if the WW3 pops off and we have someone like Kamala at the helm."
168,"Harris doesn&#39;t have a chance. They know that, only 1 candidate has any chance against TRUMP........"
169,she got my vote in november!
170,"No importa quién sea elegido, Estados Unidos seguirá cayendo."
171,How is the housing crisis NOT on the list of most important issues facing the country?
172,Love love love her❤
173,Can you imagine her cackling<br>when she is shown the code and<br>the button.........
174,They had these interviews in the can for a while
175,"Harris has a longer political career than Trump, no?"
176,She ?? She won&#39;t win.  She&#39;s even poor than Biden 😢
177,Anyone would be better than Trump
178,"Had a better shot with Biden. More annoying than Hillary Clinton, and Hillary had a far better chance at winning than harris."
179,"Dems going to hype her up so much. &amp; It&#39;s going to be a crushing defeat just like what happened to Hillary. They going to be all over Socal media after she loses, just like they were when Hillary lost."
180,They just want the identity politics votes from women and blacks. Which is IRONIC since they’re the party that “doesn’t see race”
181,TRUMP 2024!!!
182,Come on trump. From the uk 🇬🇧  come on donald. For the people for the world
183,Vote RED!! I’m voting for TRUMP 2024 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 From a California Republican.
184,Our border czar😅😅😅
185,All trump has to do is just show her cackling on all issues in tv ads
186,"Kamala Harris has absolutely NO CHANCE to win, anyone else has a better chance to beat Trump"
187,"Everyone loved Joe but I’m sensing some big, new motivation from Democrats after the announcement. Some fresh enthusiasm. Have y’all seen the new Times cover? It’s excellent in putting Kamala is a good spotlight."
188,"Much easier victory for Trump! This is still a man&#39;s world and I doubt a woman president is about to happen. Women are divided on many of the issues. Young people do not care to vote at all because they know the game. If she wins it will be just like Obama just because she is black! Her positives are she is at least younger than both, and a strong debater.  Obama&#39;s path was easy because it was something truly different and blacks knew there was only one shot at making it happen so the fact he was cool and smooth and looked like them was just icing so to speak so they voted solely on emotion. Not the same deal today. I say Trump has this election victory coming and all will just have to adjust to it. I do not care either way at this point!"
189,Weaker
190,i&#39;m all up for Kamala Harris running for office.  She&#39;s definitely got my vote.  Plus I so wanna see the first female POTUS.
191,"Kamala who? It&#39;s about time she did something during this 4 year term... Cackling Kamala lacks the intellect to take on Donald Trump. Good luck Kamala, your going to need it..."
192,Raegan would never. Alzheimers and all
193,Trump 2025🎉
194,Give me a break.....Kamala can&#39;t beat TRUMP!!!! That&#39;s hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
195,A stronger candidate than Biden?<br>😂😂😂<br>They&#39;re both a joke
196,She can’t and won’t win.
197,"Lets see how all feel about what she did at border which is nothing at all. This administration did poorly on border with 10M illegals coming in, &amp; Biden did an EO not to long ago giving Million amnesty wonder how many Dems will let a bunch of them come live with them for a while, take care of their every need out of their pocket"
198,Nobody can beat Trump😊
199,It was nightmare to have Biden as a president. We don&#39;t have another nightmare to have Harris as a president.
200,She is not African American. WJS stop running with that. She has never said she was African American. She speaks about her Indian side. This is what people like to do with words. switch them around to trick the masses. This woman is not African American. Words matter and their are people out there like myself who care about how the context of words are use and the manner they are used to attempt to trick and deceive people. Wake up people and listen to what people are saying as well as their actions.
201,"Kamala Harris definitely has the advantage in this.  She can appeal to women and LGTBQ+.  Her ethnic background will also motivate black, white, indian, pacific islanders, and rally voters with with a carribean background.  Losing Joe will be a big blow however as he was well connected with Irish, Bloods, Crips, Italian, and Polish Americans due to his upbringing in those predominant neighborhoods.  He has a close relationship with southern Baptists due to the numerous services he attended.  This is very concerning on who the next VP could be."
202,Here they go again!
203,🇺🇲 TRUMP will MAGA 🇺🇲 NO WAY will AMERICA want another 4 years of what we&#39;ve already been through with this party. Democrats are for themselves only. Republicans are united and want the AMERICAN DREAM. TRUMP WILL MAKE SURE ALL AMERICANS HAVE THAT DREAM AGAIN.  MAGA= M ake  A merica  G reat  A gain. Trump is for the PEOPLE and our great country FIRST
204,Dream on!!
205,I don&#39;t trust anything the WSJ prints anymore since Rupert.
206,"Trumps got this, but only if we all still get out there and vote to make it too big to rig! So when you go, take your fam, friends, coworkers and go vote for Trump/Vance 2024 like your life depends on it.....cause it does!"
207,For those who value time<br>Short answer: no
208,Kamala was polling at 2% in 2020. What?
209,Trump is now a shoe-in to win this November.
210,jkajajajaja kamala? jajaja
211,Kamala knows fuckall. Trump is back in the house again
212,"É assim que faz política. O show de democracia. Obrigada Deus Pai, todo poderoso. Amém."
213,Kamala harris talking about “character”  is knee slapping funny.
214,It&#39;s ridiculous to suggest Kamala is Obama. Not even close. The charisma doesn&#39;t compare.
215,"Kamala Harris graduated from a low-ranked public law school in 1989. She then failed the Bar exam (which is needed to be a licensed attorney). She finally was accepted by the California Bar a year later and IMMEDIATELY appointed as the Deputy District Attorney for Alameda County (in Oakland, California). She had no law experience. So, why did she get appointed? It turns out that she was having an affair with the Mayor of Oakland, Willie Brown. Mr. Brown went on to a statewide office in California. Kamala Harris went with him and was appointed to two different statewide offices (paid by taxpayers). She was NEVER qualified for any office or role."
216,"President Trump is brave, courageous, and stands up for Americans FIRST."
217,Giggles now? Hahaha!!! Stronger candidate? What has she done?
218,"At least Harris is younger. I was so sick and tired of having old geezers running the country. No disrespect, but in wartime I want someone who can thick quick!"
219,You guys are fast!
220,Trump is already the president <br>There is no race its been over for awhile
221,Disaster on the rise......
222,Kamala!!!
223,Kamala for POTUS 🤍🤍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🥹 ( African Indian American Women ) Reminder ☺️
224,What CAN BE unburdened by what has been...
225,"With Kamala Harris, would Democrats bet against the history of sexism and racism in the US?"
226,"RFK jr has better more exciting policies, she’s part of what’s been happening already. She is just as beholden to the military industrial complex. <br>Give Kennedy’s policy a listening to."
227,Biden was better than Harris
228,I don’t get it he’s too Alzheimer’s to run for reelection but not too Alzheimer’s to have the nuclear codes ?
229,"It&#39;s interesting how all Dems will claim that Rep don&#39;t want women to have the right to good health care as that is simple a big false statement on their part &amp; if Dems would bother really listening to the other side they would know this, but of course they will never really listen to other side, because they have to make people believe that what they say is actually real &amp; not Rep by making things up to suit the narrative they want people to go with even if it&#39;s false"
230,What? Kamala as President? 😂🤣 One joke after another?
231,Stop the cap!!!!!
232,An True American vs An Indian American. Let&#39;s go.
233,We need a  new AG too !!!
234,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
235,Harris could find Africa on a map.
236,Good timing lol
237,"What can be , unburden by what has been ."
238,"Cackling Kamala, a stronger candidate? I can&#39;t stop laughing."
239,I doubt it would happen but can you give a rundown if she picks Hilary Clinton as her vice
240,Kackeling Kamalalalama vs. Trump? Seriously?
241,We need a Jimmy Carter candidate so bad
242,Also I feel Biden still needs to campaign for Harris.
243,"The democRATS will blame everything on Weekend at Bernie&#39;s!  LOL, how she communicates, she is as good as Weekend at Bernie&#39;s!"
244,She jailed tons of people for simple marijuana charges. Sure you can say it’s the law and it shouldn’t have been broken ect but being jailed over a few grams of weed and having your life thrown out of wack?? <br><br>I’ll take trump.
245,Women don&#39;t like her.
246,Trump has proved... he can beat woman
247,They want Obama back so bad lol
248,"Now, the author of the invasion of over 10 million illegals  at the border is in display now.🚫🚩🚫🚩🚫"
249,😂strong🤣🤣she can’t even speak
250,"Perfect time tp heal the country, get a conservative republican such as Romney or Paul Ryan as a VP. Time for the country to come back together."
251,No
252,Never
253,She&#39;s even worse than Joe!!!
254,She won. Let&#39;s see what the future holds.
255,"Harris it&#39;s you that doesn&#39;t have the character to be president, Trump has a lot more than you ever would"
256,Yes!! The world is safe now with kamala harris if she will win this coming presidential election hopefully… finally biden came into his senses and gave up his presidential run.
257,"the Border czar is running for president? She had ONE job. Just ONE, and failed."
258,Trump and co underestimate her. That will become her advantage. Wait and see if she &quot;talks in rhyme&quot;.
259,So the Border czar may now be running for President? Scary thought. We know how well she did with that. Over 10 million here illegally.
260,Nope we want Newsom 😊
261,My response to the title: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
262,"“Not voting for someone who makes race their priority”<br><br><b>them also voting for a man who continues to make racist comments and say many things racial, gender, and sexuality related</b>"
263,It&#39;s not good for a woman to be in charge if she goes through menopause😊
264,"A carrot, or any other vegetable, would be a stronger opponent to Donald Trump, than Joe Biden was."
265,As a non-American viewing from the outside in - This woman seems far more suitable for the job than either of those other two pensioners..<br>I wish you luck America. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll fail to surprise and Elect the megalomaniac though.
266,Kamala seems like she takes almost nothing seriously? All she does is laugh things off -_-
267,Something tells me that all the men’s speaking in this interview had a husband at home
268,Did she propose the classified as misdemeanors certain drug possession offenses and nonviolent property crimes that do not exceed $950 in value which caused California theft in malls😅
269,Indians are doing so well in America. It is time to have an Indian president. Even a female one: first in American history!
270,"Kamala will win, Kamala will make history. HARRIS2024"
271,Older voters tend to vote more.
272,At this point they should just bring in president CAMACHO!
273,she has no power for this
274,I think Biden had a better chance of winning than Kamala cause of older voters.
275,"She has to reduce unnecessary laughing which many people don,r like."
276,"Literally, no one other than trump supporters base their vote on his scratched ear caused by another Republican."
277,"All of a sudden, she might be laughing during the debate ... sigh!"
278,How will Kamala talk about her care for Criminals in California?
279,"Kamala is a better candidate for big money donors than Biden, youth in California hated her in 2020 and Biden&#39;s inflation and genocide in Gaza coupled with her covering for his mental depreciation makes her cringe worthy personality creepy. We have just witnessed Trump&#39;s bravery under fire. Like him or not he comes across authentic."
280,England and France just rejected conservatism in their elections.
281,Can you imagine abortion being the top issue for these young women democrats?  It&#39;s just ridiculous
282,As soon as this documentary said that Kamala won against Pence in 2020 is proof that Trump will win
283,Kamala is pathetic. She&#39;ll lose big.
284,She had zero delegates in 2020.
285,Remember this people Camilla and Biden stepped in the office she replaced the American flag with the gang flag Memorial Day she insulted every man and woman who laid down their lives for this country and anyone who support you as a traitor to this country!
286,No take a look CA
287,Kamala Harris should not be the first woman president of the USA. She has brains or personality for that honour.
288,"So she&#39;s got <b>gender</b> for women votes, <b>color</b> for black votes, and promising free stuff for younger voters.<br>That about wraps up her qualifications.<br>Oh yeah...and she&#39;ll be a willing muppet, to the same people who were pulling Bidens strings."
289,Ahaha.. Harris? 😅
290,"I am Swiss. I have been following the presidential race for a while now. Let me tell you something American friends, a majority of people around the world support Trump. The reason? Is because we have access to unbiased information about the candidates. Biden was already losing the race but Harris...If you have any hope that she will win, I have some very bad news for you."
291,Word salad girl is not winnable. Trump 2024.
292,lol @ word salad nonsense jibberish speaker Harris even trying to run for President. Any reasonable person who has at least two working brain cells knows Harris would be a blatant disaster if elected president.
293,Trump&#39;s just leaving it up to the Individual states about abortion. As a Female not voting  for her
294,"Remember everyone working off tips. Trump will remove tax on tips. That will help so many people.<br> Im sick of 50% higher gas prices. 50% higher grocery prices, 50% high rent prices, 50% higher home prices."
295,Trump will win
296,Sleepy Joe voted Trump by mistake😂
297,the child inside  the mother is not your body
298,I don&#39;t know. I know Biden has been behind the best policies because of the 4 years of publicity. I just don&#39;t think I would vote Kamala. Feel like they just gave the presidency to Trump on a silver platter
299,Hillary endorse Harris Hillary is worse than biden 😂😂😂 Ru kidding me duhhhhh.😂😂😂
300,Please tell me that she will not be the nominee. Sadly she has no chance of winning. Stop the gaslighting!
301,She&#39;s a giggling goof
302,"Almost anyone is better than Trump and in almost no other country in the world, someone with the background of Trump would have close to a chance. Really sad to see what the US has become ever since Trump"
303,Trump is still winning
304,"I feel so betrayed by Biden, Harris and the entire ELECTION CAMPAIGN of these Democrats. 🤬 Harris doesn&#39;t get my vote."
305,Did he step out or was he thrown out?
306,Bwahaha Trump kriptonite.
307,She doesn’t have to be spectacular to get everyone’s attention. The bar is very low.
308,Democrat party overthrowing democracy is hilarious. They voted for Biden in the primary and tossed him aside.
309,Who could possibly listen to Kamala repeat in every speech &quot;What can be unburdened by what has been&quot; hundreds of times a year over the next four years?
310,Big mistake joe was the only one suitable to win..kamlaa is too crooked to win her criminal syndicate list is too gross ..trump just won
311,She’ll lose badly to Trump. She cannot win any swing state.
312,Ok. Unburdened us from what once was
313,Young voters are all for trump LOL
314,Shes the down fall of America 😢
315,Laughing kamala... seriously... thats it. This dude is really a washed up comedian.
316,"The last time a Democratic president left office, it resulted in the party losing the election. Well done, DNC."
317,"Welp, might as well put Trump in the office now and skip the vote. No way in heck would I vote for Harris. Not a chance. I am voting third party I suppose."
318,"Katie Porter, Bernie Sanders, or Tim Ryan would be better candidates. Maybe Vice-President."
319,I don&#39;t think so she will win this.
320,lol this is desperate. Comparing her to Obama? She’s no Obama
321,"Kamala has never giving birth - why is she the voice of abortion?? Has she used abortion as contraception?? In that case, she is the worst candidate to speak about abortion. She is the poster for what is the worst of abortion - a childless woman."
322,We shouldn&#39;t vote for the gender or for the race. We should vote for the person&#39;s values( it is difficult to find a person like that in politics as everyone lies. We need to find the candidate who thinks about USA citizens over the whole wide world. A person who can make a country for our generations to live peacefully. A person who does not create war so that our troops don&#39;t have to sacrifice their precious lives unnecessarily.
323,Ha ha ha ha ha Really?
324,I do not see this contest as policy vs policy. They are between parties. This is about Trump and his character which are not presidential vs presidential character. Any candidate from Democrats should be ok. If USA chose Trump over Biden then that is what they deserve. Kamala or any other person from democrats will not have a chance. 2020 and 2024 with Trump on one side does not make a difference. If voters cannot see that democracy is in question in the USA.
325,With a curve line everyone will beat Trump.
326,Has anyone told biden bout this yet??? Btw. Where is he? At beach again?
327,Did they seriously say she was a strong debater in 2020? She got smoked and didn’t even make it to Iowa
328,harris is an airhead
329,"Kamala Harris was Montel Williams&#39; call girl. Willie Brown had a lot of fun with her, too. Look at how many Black men went to prison, due to Kamalala&#39;s courtroom antics."
330,"She should have stopped at state level agencies, California loves exporting their sludge."
331,I&#39;ll save you 8 minutes. She is not.
332,Like to see her win and watch Trump flip out
333,For  Kamal to have a chance of winning she must come out of her school girl personality . <br>When she answers questions it reminds me of my 8 year old daughter . She does not convince me that she could run a Presidency .
334,yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 whoop whooop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
335,Trump2024 🇺🇲 🦅 💪
336,Heres the Hillary clinton saga all over again. When will the Dems learn to offer at least three candidates before nominating a specific one.
337,😂😂😂😂😂 not even close 😂😂😂😂 she is more hated then FJB.
338,WHY IS BIDEN STAYING ON AS PRESIDENT? ISN’T HE INFIRMED? IS IT THAT THEY DINT WANT HARRIS TO HAVE A RECORD AS PRESIDENT?

341,"kamala hahahahahhahah, easy day for Trump. Trump defeats her any day"
342,"I feel so betrayed by Biden, Harris and the entire ELECTION CAMPAIGN of these Democrats. 🤬 Harris doesn&#39;t get my vote."
343,There are PLENTY of white voters who can back Harris in 2024!
344,Trump 2024 ❤️others all clowns 🤡
345,WSJ no joke probably has videos for the deaths of Trump and Biden
346,"As a woman, I would never vote for a female candidate who wasn&#39;t the best and strongest fit for the job and NEVER an afterthought due to a prior candidate&#39;s senescence."
347,Delighted kamela Harris is up well done 👍
348,FFFFF this Batch. Trump all day!
349,Harris!!!
350,Harris is stronger than Biden because she’s black
351,Harris is not African American.  She is Indian/Jamaican American
352,And she does not have the character to run!
353,WSJ is owned by Rupert Murdoch. A Republican- MAGA partisan.
354,"Harris is going to be erased in November. Joe would have won. It&#39;s a tragedy for America, Ukraine and the free world. We are going to get a valuable lesson in how useless the polls are.<br>Democratic leadership are just rubbish."
355,She&#39;s got our votes !!!!
356,Kamala is wayy to late in the race; she&#39;s gonna have to pull of several graveyard shifts to match up with Trump&#39;s!!
357,Lmbo!  She was at the bttm when she was running.
358,This is so sick
359,Both Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have served all Americans well in the past and they will continue to do so in the future.<br>Vote Kamala to save USA Democracy
360,She&#39;s Slightly stronger.   She never did her 1 JOB to secure America &#39;s boarders. Never even tried. She is a major FAIL. Many died because of harris.

364,"Harris is not winning lol, she couldn&#39;t even win her own party let alone finish a primary vote<br><br>If she runs it&#39;ll be cool to see a republican win democratic states for the first time in like a century lol"
365,"Yall smacked down Biden telling him to drop out. Then, you get what you want, and all of a sudden Harris is not the best person? Man, who do yall want? Everyone just complains about who we got over and over again. Can&#39;t win with yall"
366,Trump is actually going to have to speak of his plans and policies now instead of bashing poor Sleepy Joe...whatever will Ye Old Senseless Bully do????
367,Are you kidding me? <br>“Word salad sally” will represent the United States of America???<br>And the world made fun of Biden…..
368,Heels-up/Word Salad Harris 😂😂😂😂
369,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
370,"She will never WIN..!! This is the first time for the US...Hilary loss against Trump, Harris will get the same..!!"
371,"Stronger than biden, low benchmark. But she is a doozie. Trump home. She has no children. No stake in the future. He has a dynasty. Its over"
372,Trump vs Harris it&#39;s equal to Trump (New England Patriots dynasty) vs. Harris (bad news bears)

378,FJB FKH
379,CONGRATS KAMALA.........DEMS MUST SPEND ON EXPOSRE PF CANADIDATE AS WELL AS PARTY LIKE REPUBLICANS..........20 YOU TUBERS OF REP VS 1 DEMS WITH BIDEN STICKS TO BE CANDIDATE.......FOR VICTORY DEMOCRATS MUST WORK HARD &amp; SPEND MONEY.....MORE MEETINGS ACCREOSS USA......VERY IMPORTANT
380,She’s going to lose.
381,😂😂😂😂
382,"The Democrats will lose if they nominate Kamala Harris as candidate. They must have someone who can retain and blast out the facts, call out Trump’s lies on the spot. She can’t do this."
383,Can let me know any significant change she made for the last decade?
384,Shes not strong  enough to deal with Putin and all other presidents.
385,You have got to be kidding.  She is awful.  Better to pick someone out of the phone book.
386,What pipe are they smoking out of she can&#39;t defeat Donald Trump......TRUMP 2024 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND FJB
387,How is this democratic at all? What a “clever” way to subvert our democracy
388,Kamala is not black nor African American. Stop lying. Trump got this.
389,This could easily be satire if it wasn’t real
390,Harris isn&#39;t anywhere near Obama...
391,Laughing omg this is so dam funny Kamala Harris you have no chance in the world
392,"This comment section is so full of hate, disgust and hopelessness."
393,"Sure, she is a better choice! So is the FENCE POST IN MY FRONT YARD. I &quot;WOOD&quot; vote for it before her."
394,Na she&#39;s not for us 😢😢
395,Hahahahahaha 😂😂😂
396,"No, she is not."
397,Much stronger. Biden dropping out is the worst point thing that could have happened to Trump.
398,That old man stays making bad moves !
399,"NO WAY, KAMALA FOR AMERCANS.  SHE COULD NOT TAKEN CARE OF THE BORDERS. HOW TO LEADER FOR USA? 👎👎👎."
400,Harris? 🤣 She&#39;s good at locking up black folks.
401,Every candidate is of colour.
402,"She has the best chance to win against Trump (her and Gretchen Whitmer as VP). It is time for the people of the United States to show some fairness and elect a very qualified (woman) President. That would be historic and will truly be exemplary to the world. Just on the basis of a non foul-mouthing, non-vulgar Presidential candidate (and serving as VP for four years), she should be the choice for President."
403,The Joker just took over Gotham
404,Enough about gender and race for god sake.
405,"What is the truth about Kamala Harris?  <br>Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, CA on October 20, 1964.<br><br>Harris’s mother, Dr. Shyamala G. Harris, was from India and arrived in Berkeley, CA on a Visa (Green Card) in 1960.  Dr. Harris passed away in February 2009.  Her “Legacy” obituary states that she arrived alone in the U.S. at the age of 19 after having earned her undergraduate degree from Delhi University.<br><br>Kamala’s father, Donald Harris was in the USA on a temporary Visa from Jamaica. He arrived in the U.S. in 1961 as an “Issa Scholar” from Jamaica. <br><br>Neither parent was present in the U.S. as a legal resident for five years before Harris’s birth, a requirement to apply for naturalization of Kamala&#39;s parents.  Both parents were illegally in the USA on expired temporary Visas when Kamala was born.<br><br>Because the available public records fail to confirm that both her mother and her father were, on October 20, 1964, naturalized U.S. citizens, she is not eligible to be Vice President or POTUS.  Kamala Harris is NOT a “natural born Citizen” of the United States per Article 2 US Constitutional standards. She was born with citizenship and allegiance requirements to two countries, India and Jamaica. She does not have unity of citizenship and sole allegiance to the USA. She was born and raised with foreign influences on her because both parents were foreigners. The Constitution does not allow a Commander-in-Chief with birth allegiance to another country.<br><br>Although the Constitution of 1787 mentioned citizens, it did not define citizenship. In 1868 a definition of citizenship entered the Constitution with the ratification of the 14th Amendment. Here is the familiar language: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Thus, there are two components to American citizenship: birth or naturalization in the U.S. and subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Today, we somehow have come to believe that anyone born within the geographical limits of the U.S. is automatically subject to its jurisdiction; but this renders the jurisdiction clause utterly superfluous. If this had been the intention of the framers of the 14th Amendment, presumably they would have said simply that all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. are thereby citizens, but they didn&#39;t.<br><br>Indeed, during a debate over the amendment, Senator Jacob Howard, the author of the citizenship clause, attempted to assure skeptical colleagues that the language was not intended to make Indians citizens of the United States. Indians, Howard conceded, were born within the nation’s geographical limits, but he steadfastly maintained that they were not subject to its jurisdiction because they owed allegiance to their tribes and not to the United States.  Senator Lyman Trumbull, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, supported this view, arguing that “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” meant “not owing allegiance to anybody else and being subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United States.”<br><br>Jurisdiction understood as allegiance, Senator Howard explained, excludes not only Indians but “persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, or who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.” * Thus, “subject to the jurisdiction” does not simply mean, as is commonly thought today, subject to American laws or courts. It means owing exclusive political allegiance to the U.S."
406,I’m a defense contractor. The chance of WW3 is much higher with Harris. I’m voting for Harris.
407,What? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
408,"By the rules in place Harris gets all the pool of money with Biden out - time to rally, how to get voters??"
409,"Good afternoon, I wish with all my heart that people vote for her, because she has virtues and qualities, may GOD win, not the devil, furthermore, a person who has a black resume cannot be president again,<br>Please, all Americans vote for her, for peace and love, for democracy,<br>I do not agree that people with a bad resume can be president again, also, like many American citizens, when you have a blemished resume, it is difficult to get a job, so the law should be for everyone, ok"
410,Kamala is a disaster just like our Border. She is going to lose worse than Sleepy Joe.
411,Harris is Indian. Her father is Jamaican. She has never said she’s African American.
412,RFK jr for VP and she would win.
413,She is a joke as well go trump.....
414,"Harris hasn&#39;t been any ability in politics we can see from last 3.5 years. If she can be elected the next president, that is only a thing to say--US has gone too far on the track of political correctness and never returned again😂. If that so, America will degrade in the 30-50 years."
415,Let&#39;s go Kamala! Get Kendrick Lamar and Michelle Obama to write out you platform speeches
416,Let&#39;s go trump!!!!
417,VP Harris is not African American. She is an Indian/Caribbean American. But most of all she is simply an American (USA). She is NOT &quot;black.&quot; I&#39;ve abhorred folks calling themselves by colors for decades. African Americans &amp; European Americans have been duped into this crazy skin color naming of people thing of &quot;race&quot; for centuries. There&#39;s no such thing as a white or black person. (you don&#39;t call Asian Americans folk yellow). Skin color is NOT equal to ethnicity or any sort of identity of a person.
418,"Yes ,  She will Win 👑"
419,Yea nope
420,As a What woman
421,Only americans would call a person who is half indian half jamaican an african american lol
422,Democrats literally switched Biden back with Kamala like it’s a boxing match 💀 <br><br>Democrats really thought they were playing a Pokémon battle 💀 <br><br>Democrats really said “Switch” like it’s an rpg game 💀 <br><br>Democrats really thought that Kamala Harris needed to regain her hp after she was starting to be smoked by Trump last election 💀 <br><br>Democrats really thought they were playing the rebooted game mode from Fortnite 💀 <br><br>Democrats really thought they wouldn’t get Ko’d by the assassination incident if they switched candidates 💀
423,Kamel face will lose miserably.
424,If i didn&#39;t already know who they were talking about.... I wouldn&#39;t know who they were talking about😮
425,"And here it comes....the leftist media going to play on repeat over and over and over again how Kamala is the greatest thing in the world in all of history. And oddly enough, a lot of you WILL fall for it. Doesn&#39;t take much!"
426,If you thought Kamala won against Biden than I think your having the same aspirations as you did when Biden was gonna debate trump. As much as nobody likes pence he beat Kamala in the debate
427,Man am riding with trump all day ! Easy money
428,I saw a man with a Obama hat on today… he was homeless. All this identity politics minority this that woman this that race this that is doing nothing but accelerating the demise of this great nation.
429,She combines the worst of Obama and Hillary
430,First one OUT of the dems primary last time around.  Joke
431,Unbelievable 😂
432,Hmmm no ma’am. Haven’t seen her 10 times seen elected
433,I wonder if p diddy will vote for her?
434,The choice is clear Kamala or PROJECT 2025 check it out
435,Kamala  ?......hmmm  worst  than Biden...😂
436,Shes african american? Thought she was asian Jamaican.
437,Please Remember...it&#39;s not Joe or his age that are the problem...<br>It&#39;s the policies of the democratic party...<br>Kamala will simply be the next puppet on their list of easy to manipulate people<br>Promise her the Presidency and she&#39;ll sign whatever piece of paper they lay in front of her.
438,Definitely no Trump. He caused heartbeat for everyone and instability to the world.
439,"DEI pick. Is, was and will remain that."
440,She&#39;s sucking up to the woke. And she also said the word &quot;freedom&quot;. This is a bad sign I guess
441,Did she find her KNEE pads??
442,Honestly I had just decided to switch to biden after trumps vp pick but now I gotta switch back to trump since Kamala is an advocate for all of joes worst policies...
443,English articles Archives - Επίσημη σελίδα των φίλων τού Παναγιώτη Τραϊανού ..Google it
444,What about Pete Buttigegg ?
445,Kamalahahahahahaha. Nothing is funny about her running.
446,Trump’s ear is stronger than Kamala after taking a bullet.
447,will not happen..Bernie is the only one who can win
448,Tampon Don doesn’t have a chance! <br>Vote Blue through &amp; through!<br>🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸
449,Kamala you got this ❤❤❤❤
450,Old Joe drop for &quot;FREE ICE CREAM&quot; for life ! 😂
451,I like Kamala Harris!
452,libs are so sad they are just trying to hold on to the senate at this point.. Trump is going to wipe the floor with her or any democrat after they show open borders. record high inflation. super high crime. nobody is doing good......  she had 1 job the border and failed horrible..
453,And There was Several Little Girls WHO Were Killed By Illegal Immigrants!!
454,No
455,"This isnt about 2024. Its about 2028. Dems painted themselves into a corner by taking on Harris: the least liked among all the 2020 Dem contestants. But they needed the help of the black female vote to come close enough to &quot;appear&quot; to beat Trump. But Harris has always been a liability. But she&#39;d be an incumbent in 2028 should Biden win this time around. Once the Dems saw JD Vance as the vp pick for the Repubs, and witnessed the groundswell of support after Trump survived the assassination attempt, they knew Biden/Harris must go. This is bigger than Biden. Its a play for the future. Think bigger."
456,"Thank you, Mr. President, for your wisdom, character and selfless patriotism.  It takes a better man to put country before one’s self and endorse Vice President, Kamala Harris. You have my full unwavering support.  Vote Blue up and down the ballot!  Vote for equal justice and the rule of law!  Vote Blue and Save Our Democracy!"
457,It&#39;s great to have Trump back in the White House!
458,I wasn&#39;t even gonna vote. Now im voting for Trump 100%
459,"Nope. Black men aren&#39;t going to vote for her. I say this as a black man myself, who voted Obama 2x. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#Trump2024</a>"
460,They wouldn&#39;t even let me add that your irresponsible to my previous comment..insane
461,"Comparing Harris as an orator to Obama, now that is hilarious!"
462,"Could have tried Michelle Obama, at least she would have been more credible than Kamala. A wet noodle would have more chance of winning."
463,All of these comments are just spot on
464,Hahahahha all they have is Kamala lol
465,Don&#39;t just focus in one race division bait.. it&#39;s a failed campaign again. All voters Matters! Stop being selfish and insecure.
466,"She is a disaster, this will be very humorous to watch."
467,"&quot;What can be, unburdened by what has been.&quot;🤣🤣🤣"

478,"If  corporate media does it&#39;s job,   they will now focus on ancient demented Donnie&#39;s decomposing mental deterioration."
479,She won’t be the candidate 🤦🏽‍♂️
480,&quot;African American&quot; woman⁉
481,only Bernie can beat dump
482,Trump stance on abortion is the states decide. How is that restrictive?
483,Ugh she would be a disaster.
484,Kamala Harris is too laid back to be president and you guys saw what happened with Hillary in 2016
485,Kamala doesn&#39;t have a &quot;vision&quot;
486,Harris is NOT African American!! Harris has a Mother from &quot;India&quot; and her Father is in &quot;Jamaica&quot;.
487,The gaslight is craaaazy. Her numbers would probably be lower than those of biden.
488,she a Marxist
489,"Is there anyone who won’t lie for this WH? So pathetic to listen to this news group, more 🤡 on stage. She will never win, unless they cheat again!"
490,"I thought Harris was Indian and chinese, she is black ?"
491,😮😅😂
492,Who?
493,She can&#39;t even get huge crowds because her rating suck.
494,"She was a diversity hire hahaha as a trump voter, i hope he runs against her. It&#39;d be a much easier W"
495,Harris has no chance against trump
496,"Kamala is a very smart, strong and capable person. She will make an incredibly effective president."
497,It’s the current VP against the Republican criminal.
498,Presiden corte nomina hobama casa blanca
499,How long till they block comments ?
500,No
501,Harris you are hiding when you are vice pres
502,Women Power !  👍💪⚖️🦅🇺🇸💙🕊️🌹
503,Nope
504,Not a forgone conclusion that it will be her. Pelosi is right to want a mini primary.
505,"She cant win, you need someone who can take away the division . <br>Thats the best thing what the people can have."
506,"If she’s a woman in color, is she multilingual too?"
507,Its over. Trump has already won 💙
508,Harris has a worse chance.
509,Let&#39;s have a true open convention. Kamala Harris is the SECOND WEAKEST after Biden...<br>CORNEL WEST<br>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON<br>JILL STEIN<br>I know I am not the only person who would NEVER vote Kamala.....
510,"Obviously, no. She is as bad, if not worse, than Joe."
511,"The most fake person which they could choose from the whole Democratic party, did that party have anyone who is actually not having a fake smile and and giving a classical Chat GPT speeches?"
512,Zero chance of winning. Trump 2024.
513,no
514,"I don&#39;t know if Harris can defeat Trump or not, but I can predict one thing for sure. If Harris loses, she will blame sexism and white supremacy as the reason why she lost. Mark my words."
515,Haven’t seen her actively speaking on policies or anything at all. Forgot she was the VP
516,If you tried DEI you will fail
517,"Harris is the same as Biden, look at the destruction of our country. Trump is the better candidate for President. Go Trump make America Great Again. 🇺🇲"
518,She&#39;s not African American. Her parents are from Jamaica and India.
519,"I was bussed downtown from the outskirts of Louisville, Ky in the 80&#39;s. Those busses ran two ways."
520,"Remember people, if you&#39;re black, female or both than you must vote for Kamala Harris because she&#39;s also a black woman therefore she has your best interest in mind. <br>Also night in shining armor is a racist sexist statement how dare he! 😂"
521,"Kamala Harris. African American? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=176"">2:56</a>"
522,ANYONE is a better candidate than Trump!  All he has is his massive ego and the backing of millionaires and billionaires who will profit off his policies.
523,Kamala isn&#39;t that popular amongst people not registered as Democrats plus she hardly has the support of most Democrats. Biden did the damage and is basically setting up Kamala to fail
524,The country has fallen so hard that they’re trying to push for a woman president again. 🤦‍♂️ <br>This is a huge L.
525,Could you imagine a debate between Trump and Kamala.  She will be destroyed on policy and everything else.  Horrrible.  How can anyone who loves America really consider her.  I would take Michelle Obama over her.
526,Give me a break k H is awful
527,?African American woman????????
528,Trump 2024
529,You just can&#39;t make this stuff up anymore!! 😂
530,RIGHT!
531,The dems are toast. She is the most untalented politician they could have gone with.
532,"Noway,she is not a leader,she made no effort as vice president, no,thats just not ok,if joe biden steps out of being a president that would give  Harris a few days, but she is not a leader to noone."
533,Just pressed DISLIKE BUTTON 😁
534,LOL she has been the worst Vice President in history.  She speaks and acts like a 10th grader!
535,😂
536,"I fail to understand how Kamala Harris would be a better candidate than Joe Biden considering that she was one of the least popular &quot;major&quot; candidates in the 2020 primaries and has spent the last 4 years being almost as invisible and inconsequential as Melania Trump.<br><br>Essentially, with nothing new to show for herself, how is she supposed to beat Trump in 2024 when she couldn&#39;t even beat Biden (or Buttigieg, or Booker, etc.) in 2020?"
537,It&#39;s Joever. Welcome to Trump 2024...
538,Still weak . Trump will win .
539,"This has got to be a joke, a very bad joke!!"
540,All about her race and not her policies…
541,"Feminism won’t win this one. Sorry to disappoint. Trump by a Landslide. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wokestreetjournal"">#WokeStreetJournal</a>"
542,"They keep pushing that she’s a black woman lol. Notice they never mention or show her husband or parents (just google them). Also they never mention her policies in cali hurt blacks the most . Oh and lastly, most people don’t even know about the affair that propelled her ascent into politics… RFK 2024"
543,"People not voting policy but perception of character (after egregious censorship) is what brought us to this mayhem in the first place. That and the 4a.m. anomaly, no ID required to vote, unguarded street ballot boxes, etc."
544,"Cackling Unburdened Kamala has an uphill battle, she’s definitely no Obama 🤷🏼‍♀️🤡💩"
545,"Naa, no chance she wins"
546,Kamala polls far worse than Biden 😂
547,We want the candidate that will stand up for women&#39;s rights!
548,Kamala Harris No.1 Choice ❤
549,Wait until Joe Biden finds out about this!
550,Big poooof
551,"man they are ramping up the spin machine quickly. these are same &quot;news&quot; outlets that wanted us to believe we needed to wear masks, that vaccines work, that Biden wasn&#39;t mentally gone, or that the left cares about democracy (even though we aren&#39;t one anyway)."
552,Kamala harris
553,her catch line is &quot;do not come&quot;
554,Isnt she the one who was controlling Biden?
555,Oh Yeah! Definately stronger!!! Momala should pick Dylan Mulvaney for VP! 😂😂😂 They&#39;d be unstoppable!!!
556,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=149"">2:29</a> since when did Ken Jennings turn political?"
557,SO QUICK ON THE NEW PROPAGANDA.  IMPRESSIVE.
558,Ok now I’m voting!!!! Before I was staying home!! But let’s get in formation family!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤ HARRIS!!!
559,❗ THE HOUSE OF CARDS HAVE FALLEN DOWN.... ITS OVER DEMS... ITS F.. ING OVER
560,She&#39;s even worse than Biden. No Thank You.
561,"No, Harris can&#39;t beat Trump. The DNC has once again offered us up some of their slop. Don&#39;t think for a second that this was not all perfectly orchestrated by the Democratic party. If Biden had stepped down in a timely manner, it would have opened up the contenders for the presidential race. Now it is TOO LATE, and they will choose Harris for us. What a joke this party of &quot;DEMOCRACY&quot; has become. This is more like what like what China and Russia does. It&#39;s all rigged."
562,"SHE&#39;S NOT AFRICAN AMERICAN, her father is Jamaican and her mother is Indian. Lying again"
563,But he promised in 2024 to win 2020 elections.
564,We have been unburdened by what has been! Now shed the baggage.
565,"Biden presidency was a disappointment. If they put his VP as the candidate, they will lose. It needs to be someone not tied to the Biden tree"
566,No chance 😂
567,"Kamala Harris is a joke, worst VP ever…!   TRUMP 2024 🇺🇸💪🏻"
568,Trump 2024.
569,Not.. she can’t win
570,She won 4 percent of the vote...
571,😂😂😂😂
572,Hilarious!
573,Vice president Harris is not black😢
574,Kamala has no chance with Trump  she is the reason for our Border Crisis No way
575,What can be unburned by what has been 😅
576,"So, the plan is to play the race card to get dems within cheating distance... got it ."
577,The democrat party is so out of touch with Americans
578,She&#39;s already lost
579,"WSJ, I feel like this needs to be said. People of the same race can vote differently and have difference political affiliations."
580,I endorse Kamala Harris (and she has my vote for our next president).
581,"Yay 😂, Trumps our next President, again!!! I&#39;m a black woman!!!!"
582,"Harris2024 <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yeswecanagain"">#yeswecanagain</a>"
583,Nah RFK Jr is the answer. Stop silencing him with your agendas.
584,Trump wins much easier now
585,"Kamala was never anything more than Insurance for Joe Biden. We wont remove him, because she is WORSE. The Democrats get what they prepared for, a loss and a mess. The country was never ever put 1st, not then, not Now."
586,Be scared trump!!!
587,you people who see yourselves political as pendents with a finger on the pulse of the desires of the American people are fooling yourselves if you think that Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump. I will be really shocked at the incompetence of the Democratic Party if she ends up the nominee.<br><br>Word on the street Is that while she was a prosecutor she put a lot of people of color behind bars for nonviolent crimes. That&#39;s a rhetoric that lost Hillary Clinton the campaign and it&#39;s gonna be the same thing for Harris.
588,ZZZ... wake me up when Trump wins.
589,"One Word,  NO....Kamala Harris is an absolute disaster , she polls lower than Joe Biden if you can believe that !! She has absolutely zero chance of beating Trump !!"
590,She can&#39;t put 2 words together. What a joke.
591,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#Trump2024</a>"
592,Harris doesn&#39;t stand a chance.
593,She’s 59.  Hallelujah.
594,"Kamala  is  a  decent  person  and  a  very  smart  lady  i  wish  her  best  of  luck  for  next  4  years  she  will  be  a  shinning  light   for  all  americans  black  or  white ,  Joe  Biden served  his  country  for  last  50  years  what  a  decent  man  he  is  i  wish  him well  ."
595,she about as &quot;african american&quot; as joe is not senile
596,"If blacks and Hispanics come together, Harris will win ."
597,HARRIS FOR VICE PRESIDENT 2024!!!<br>🔵 🔵 🔵 🔵 <br>🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 <br>😁😁😁😁
598,Kamala toe
599,please just stop trump 😅
600,Former Prosecutor. Debate or Trial. She already says Trump is Guilty. Conflict of interest.
601,America fouled up last time a woman ran. Let’s not screw up again!
602,strong lol
603,RIP BIDEN 😂
604,Kamala Harris is the worst candidate to beat Trump now!
605,Para empesar nunca ayudo a controller la emigracion ilegal
606,"Now I’m really worried that trump might win. I really hope Harris can win, ‘cause anyone would be better than trump a lier, an atheist, a lawbreaker, a narcissist with money."
607,"Doesn&#39;t matter who the Dems pick, Trump won."
608,Kamala Harris! Let&#39;s go! 🙌
609,HAHAHAHAHAHA the kackler
610,Our government is a mess. What is giggles going to do for our government.
611,The dating scene has made black men more conservative than ever.<br>We really not rocking with harris like that
612,"Biden has been the greatest gift to Trump and the republicans this year and he also went out with a bang by endorsing Harris.  Idc what The WSJ says, lol, Kamala has the least chance of beating Trump.  You stabbed Joe Biden and he stabbed you back.  The democrats ticket will not include two women so you can forget it may include Michelle Obama or Hillary as her VP.   Not gonna happen.  And if they Snub Harris, it will be the biggest black eye for this party.  <br><br>So yes, thank you Joey!!  Like Jill said:  You did good…."
613,Bernie Sanders for VP 2024
614,WSJ was being edged with biden dropping out
615,No.
616,She only make sense when she talk about yellow school buses 🚌 😢😢😢
617,Ummm….NO!!! Not even close.
618,Have Kamala Harris take the cognitive test like Trump did I bet she won’t pass
619,"I&#39;m sure the WSJ is fully aware that Kamala only garnered 1% of the &#39;20 California primary vote, even the vast majority of fruits and nuts wanted nothing to do with her. If it weren&#39;t for rigged elections she wouldn&#39;t be VP. I didn&#39;t watch this leftist drivel but I doubt those facts got mentioned."
620,Trump is going to be the 47th President 🇺🇸 like it or not everything is going to be ok a true leader the peoples president Trump/Vance 2024
621,"Even stranger they’re saying it was trump, when it was banned in multiple states two years ago, under Bidens term. Trump never even spoke on abortion."
622,Google Kamala awkward moment.
623,"Harris holds no chance, she’s as bad as Biden, actually she’s worse."
624,"Please America vote Kamala Harris, I think the world would be so much better. And get rid of Trump, this error of history."
625,Kamalaugh? Really? 🤣🤣🤣
626,Are you for real 😍🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂☺
627,"For the LAST  TIME  ; Harris is NOT BLACK,  not even a little bit.  SHE is of Indian descent......................."
628,A prosecutor against a convicted felon
629,NOT EVEN CLOSE
630,Harris does not have a chance. Trump will eat her up. She was in charge of the border and never did go to the border one time.
631,"<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx""></a>🤣😂 Stong in what sense, in stupidity yes."
632,No no no no no!<br>They are better off nominating a duck 🦆 than Kamala Harris
633,She&#39;s just a weaker puppet😂
634,Physically stronger but still the same mush mouth language.
635,"Harris as POTUS would be such a disaster, making America an even bigger international joke than we already are.."
636,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa🤠
637,Lol this has got to be a joke she doesn&#39;t stand a chance against Donald Trump
638,"she becomes president, it will be the end of humanity"
639,She&#39;s so much worse!
640,It&#39;s not the bullet that is a nightmare for Trump. Trump&#39;s worst nightmare is Kamala Harris
641,Who did Harris blow this time?
642,We love our President Trump
643,TRUMP2024
644,"She couldn&#39;t even debate Tulsi Gabard, Trump will tear her apart"
645,Kamala couldn&#39;t even handle Tulsi Gabbard in the debates. How is she going to handle Trump??
646,"Tulsi would be way better than crackling harris. I was going to vote Biden but since harris is going to be president, i will vote trump instead. When biden chosed harris as VP, i was 50/50 against and support it, half of it being that she a liar and was humiliated. Harris also put more black in jails during her career and leave them in prison to serve more in order to use them for labor, her white husband is proud of that and joe biden crime bill law supported harris career since so many blacks were the prime target. This is why i dont support harris. I dont support trump at all, i know nothing of his achievements but i will vote for him just becuase i dont like her. Had joe biden stayed in the race, i would change my votes at all"
647,Kamala is smart and beautiful both inside and outside! I think she will win and please pick AOC as second president.
648,Black voters voting the same way and expecting a different result? Reminds me of a famous quote on the definition of insanity.
649,Go Kamala Harris...she has a great chance of winning. Donald is old and is not the best choice f American. 💓💓
650,"Rather, you like Obama or not. Kamala Harris is no Obama. I think they’re forgetting. She dropped out at her last presidential campaign before a single vote was cast. The best thing she can say is that I wasn’t the president for the last four years. She’s not even a good debater, she was crushed twice one as a potential presidential nominee and then second as a vice president nominee. So they should probably lay off the Kool-Aid."
651,She&#39;s like another monster coming against godzilla....<br><br>She&#39;ll lose...
652,"I hope there is an open convention. Kamala might win, but I don&#39;t want her to just be chosen right away with out any rigorous debate or process. We deserve at least an open convention."
653,It a proven fact Trump does not do well when challenged by African American women.
654,VP 2 PRESIDENT (2025-)🎉✨️🎈🇺🇸🇺🇸
655,The country is silk of Trump &#39;s disgusted language
656,She is a joke as well......
657,哈里斯窜党夺权，背叛民主背叛拜登背叛全体民主党员，是美国的耻辱，无权代表民主党参选。民主党是全体民主党员的政党，不是党内大佬和金主私有的政党。今天是美国最黑暗的一天。
658,Kamala genuinely cares about and supports all groups and communities. Trump Really Does Not.
659,LOL
660,"Kamala Harris could never be Obama , stop lying to people. <br>Harris is going to get smashed in this election"
661,How atr u going to keep ud out of war!
662,"Kamala will lose bigly.  My mom, a diehard Dem, will not vote for her."
663,"Ain’t no way, no one like her."
664,"Came here to learn about Kamala&#39;s policies, left with a strong feeling that Americans are obsessed with race. How many years (or decades) do I have to wait until it&#39;s about merit and not racial characteristics?"
665,"We couldn&#39;t elect a white lady against Trump. The DNC wants Trump in power, obviously"
666,Harris looks viable demographically but that&#39;s where the hope train departs and immediately derails in a cataclysm of anti-charisma.
667,People will once again vote according to their habits and to their emotions NOT in the best of the country
668,Not very realistic this &quot;story&quot;!
669,"Trujillo is incorrect, Jamaican-Indian not African American"
670,lol Harris is worst than Biden.
671,A vote to &quot;save democracy&quot; while forcing out the candidate who was democratically elected to be the Democrat candidate.
672,"A vote for Harris to be president is about as dumb as a vote for Biden. Voting for the Democratic Party is voting to become a socialist nation. How can any American who has a dream vote for the Democratic Party? It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s Harris, Biden, or some other head Democrat. You&#39;re voting for America to fail as a nation."
673,We’ll have a female President in January 2025 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Trump can go to a mental health asylum next year
674,Hardly! Kamal is a joke! 🤡
675,WSJ already knew this would happen 😂 the left knows that they need something controversial to counter the wave of the right. I like this show!
676,Only one person is disliked more than biden. Kamala
677,We vote for Trump !!!!
678,The election is about whether Agenda 2025 should be implemented. If Trump wins he would be the oldest person to be inaugurated. It is conceivable that he would make way for his 39 year old deputy who appears even more conservative.<br>Should not the democrats pick a strong candidate rather than one who laughs all the time?
679,I sincerely hope I am wrong but we just anointed King Trump.
680,Why does WSJ already have this video up their sleeve?
681,"Who did a better job AT THE BORDER, TRUMP!!!!! , Harris has no chance."
682,They will print more money and the US Dollar will drop hard and then inflation goes up again.
683,"Not even close Hillary lost to trump, Kamala will do even worse. its like the democrats have short term memeory loss. Zero chance she wins now. Enjoy 4 years of trump. I as blue voter see this as betrayl of my primary vote. Unless they show biden has some medical condition that forced him to drop out. If it was we think we are going to lose... Sorry i wont vote for that party anymore. if you have no loyalty."
684,"Short answer no, long answer, no......seriously no just pick someone else who ran earlier this year"
685,This is why they got rid of the dislike counter!
686,The country that has lost it moral law yet it doesn&#39;t even know
687,"That makes sense! Biden was not well physically and cognitively, but Trump was insane, dumb and a delusional sociopath. Kamala Harris is no saint, but waaaaaaaay better than Trump. She&#39;s gonna win."
688,"Never agaain im Gonna vote democrats! Was my last time! This woman is even the bigger joke than biden! Imagine meeting leaders like putin, erdogan or xi jinping! Kamala is worst than Biden!"
689,She doesn&#39;t  stand a chance!
690,Trump trounces Harris.
691,Trump 2024🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🙏💯💯💯❤️❤️
692,"Well played Obamas, well played !<br>Kamela-Hillary 2024 !!!!!!!!<br>Unstoppable !!!"
693,"Yeah, not really"
694,If you ain&#39;t voting her she ain&#39;t Black! Which incidentally she isn&#39;t she is Indian and Jamaican
695,"She got my vote for this presidency. Their policies have targeted helping middle class in terms of students Loan relief, getting the economy back from covid (although with inflation) passing CHIPS act and other bulls to to bring back some manufacturing jobs and at least puts them In a position to do this in the long term. But safety remains and immigration remains a big issue. They need to put their foot down and understand that immigration and safety is closely correlated and need to do something about it. Need to refund the police!"
696,One advantage Harris has is that she speaks word salad fluently
697,Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar 2024🎉
698,Trump will destroy her. But now the MSM will change the narrative and feed lies.
699,Why the issue of abortion is being taken so seriously in America
700,Haris likes to put innocent people in jail for smoking weed but yet she also smokes weed and laugh her head off at everything that you find funny just like a regular weed smoker ha ha ha
701,Hillary better support her from a <br>....distance
702,Trump Trump Trump
703,What a joke of a video.
704,She need Pete Buttigeg as VP
705,why did he quit? are they so divided among themselves in that party? how can they run a nation when they themselves are internally so divided?
706,May she win ❤ kindness and honesty over lies and agression 🙏 please may she win 🌍🕊️
707,Vive président Kamala Harris.  God is with you. If God is with you got it all<br><br>Vigie président Harris
708,😂😂 keep reaching WSJ
709,Kamala is worst than Biden
710,This views and information are important. thank You.
711,"Good, a second time trump beats a woman in the election 😂"
712,"Dems are just banking on the millions in the usual &quot;Vote Blue No Matter Who&quot; states who&#39;ll vote <b>against</b> Trump, instead of having to actually come up with a compelling candidate."
713,Are you guys high? She has absolutely no shot AT ALL
714,"Trump&#39;s advantage: populism, charisma, traditional family and American values, resiliency in the face of relentless opposition, survivability<br>Kamala&#39;s advantage: identity politics, she likely has a uterus, the significance of the passage of time, good at putting people behind bars for weed and laughing about it while stoned"
715,All they know is how to cheat not lead...
716,"Hakeem Jeffries POTUS,  Gavin Newsom VP .      <b>Jeffries is a much improved version of Obama.</b>    And Newsom would kill loony Vance in the debate."
717,Quelle catastrophe !
718,Ok boomer News keep dreaming
719,"She is not African-American , father Jamaican , Mother India."
720,"Trump&#39;s winning. No way Harris can beat him, zero."
721,You should check facts sometime. Trump said it&#39;s every state&#39;s decision. He doesn&#39;t want to control women&#39;s bodies.
722,She locked up an innocent man and laughed about it
723,Quite a mismatch!
724,So next few months will be all about playing the victim card and racism non-stop.
725,She is so unbearable
726,TBH I forgot Harris was around lol<br><br>Also make Bernie VP give the man something!
727,SHE IS JUST &quot;BLACK&quot; DID DEAL ?
728,First Female President yes
729,Trump 2024
730,WSJ shame on you for posting such propaganda 😔 stop lying to the American people. This race ended before it even began Trump 2024 🔒
731,Yet she couldn&#39;t even be in the top 10 nominee for the last election. Nobody wanted her
732,Hahahahaha
733,I am a YOUNG woman and Harris does NOT have my vote! nope!
734,She will nail Trump to the cross! :)
735,Another Hillary like candidate to fail.  Ameticans choose Trump over Hillary why not against kamala.
736,"Chracter? She&#39;s been caught red handed withholding exculpatory evidence of those she prosecuted. Very concerning when it comes to &quot;character&quot;, especially calling trumps character out....though no one possess zero blemishes. Trump certainly has his chracter flaws."
737,"People reactions are based on emotions not facts📚. While President Trump may win the popular vote, it’s all about the ELECTORAL COLLEGE! We might witness an upset 👀? The hate is unreal against VP Harris (and Blacks), but it all boils down to what direction Americans want to go in🙏🏿."
738,Trump❤
739,We need Kennedy!
740,"NOR DOES SHE, BOTTOM LINE."
741,Kamala stronger? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
742,She dont have a prayer.<br>They better get Michelle Obana
743,😂😂😂😂😂😂
744,Next she needs a Latino VP.
745,"Apart from Joe, any American on the planet can be a better candidate against Trump."
746,I&#39;m ready for an reenergized vote for Harris!!!
747,Failed Harris dropped in disgrace after failing to win a single delegate. She has failed as vp . What a joke
748,"You are smoking somthing if you think Harris is a stronger candidate than Trump. Harris is a FAILED AG, FAILED presidential candidate (first one to drop out after Gabbords pointed out how corrupt she was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WabvabWvv8k)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WabvabWvv8k)</a>, and a FAILED VP who has FAILED at the jobs she has been given. She has no track record to run. She FAILED as the border czar. And her speeches are word salad repetition: &quot;significance of the passage of time,&quot; &quot;yellow school bus,&quot; &quot;you need to get to go and need to be able to get where you need to go get work and get home,&quot; and then trying to define culture."
749,At least Biden had a soul. Nobody likes Kamala. She will lead to a Trump LANDSLIDE
750,They think this is bad now? Wait until Kamala starts laughing and talking without being hidden....What a train Wreck!
751,"GOD MESSAGE TO CROOKED MAFIA NEWS: Any human being with DIGNITY IS STRONGER than MAFIA TRUMP and MAGA including yourself CROOKED CORRUPTED CORPORATE NEWS let along a REAL CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT!<br>MESSAGE TO MRS. KAMALA HARRIS: Mrs. Kalama Harris, I believe there is mafia behind, but now OUR DEMOCRACY and FREEDOM are PLACED FIRMLY ON YOUR SHOULDERS! <br>1- YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE TOO ELOQUENT TO BE A GREAT DEVOTED PRESIDENT WHO DOES GOOD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE from bottom up!! <br>2- It&#39;s time for the VAIN PEOPLE TO WAKE UP about HOW TO VOTE RIGHT for themselves and for our freedom and democracy! <br>3- THIS IS WHAT OUR PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SAID: We build this country from bottom up!! That is rock solid scientific and political HONESTY. I LOVE IT, EVERY SINGLE WORD!"
752,"Anyone but Trump is a reality now that Biden is out of the race. Democrats can pick just about anybody and win, so they might as well pick someone who actually represents them"
753,WSJ and MSNBC are preparing for this campaign
754,Trump and the GOP are going to lose.
755,Kamala Harris 😂😂🤣<br><br>Good luck 🤞 trying to convince Black men!
756,Is it just me or is Spencer Kimball&#39;s voice is so similar to John Dickerson???
757,Vice president Pamela Harris has my vote all Democrats move to stand for president woman
758,Don&#39;t look up 😅
759,She will never win.she not strong to be a president
760,Young black males feel about Kamala the way older white males feel about Hillary. Kamala easily doubles the percentage and number of young black male votes that Trump gets. Kamala will also cost Dems older white votes.
761,use me as a “trump was right again” button!
762,"She has the same shot, and maybe she can change the tone in the race."
763,WSJ a propaganda demonrat mouth piece. Biden was pushed out and they put a new puppet in.
764,"Trump: Crazy Nancy...Oh, Sorry, Crazy Harris😂"
765,I hate how some people are called &quot;people of color&quot; like they were somehow worse than white people.
766,"Actually, she&#39;s not African American!"
767,"most of these channels won&#39;t even allow comments on such videos, says a lot, and as you can see here:<br>7300 likes<br>5500 dislikes<br><br>that&#39;s the reason they&#39;re hiding dislikes on youtube, back when mister 81 million votes was getting downvoted into oblivion"
768,She&#39;s Hilary 2.0 but worse.
769,It seems she doesn’t even believe what’s she saying herself..also she was selected not elected..
770,Whites blacks Latinos  asians indians Middle east Even democrats we all  voting for trump  no chance kamala Harris  going to win <br>  TRUMP 2024 🇺🇸
771,She&#39;s going to wipe the floor with him. Vote blue
772,Harris is so much the group that’s destory justice system and our country
773,"Kamala, you have to fight hard these people don&#39;t want to see a black woman for President God go wid u 🙏"
774,Another biased piece to sell you a nobody<br>who has done nothing as VP for the last 4 years<br>aside of talking about Venn diagrams
775,"F all that,she&#39;s worse"
776,The left must have forgot about Tulsi destroying Kamala in 2019. If Tulsi accomplish that by herself what do you think Trump and his team will do?
777,How does she favor with the Latino vote?
778,Awww I love my Biden 💙 and I love Kamala❤
779,the only thing stronger kamala harris has over trump is stronger knee caps.
780,shame on wsj
781,Both of her Mother and Father are not American born
782,Trump 2024!!!! FJB
783,Shame. But I&#39;m sure Vance that Trump has to mop the floors with her words salads and border work. <br><br>So easy.
784,"Country is on fire and we are talking about justice agenda between rust belt and black voters ? Seriously , how about candidate that will improve life of both ? We are living in the same country , just a reminder"
785,"We shall see? Kamala Harris has to show more than just articulation in her campaign, she would have to show that she has the stamina to lead and the determination to make crystal clear decisions. Yes, she needs a strong base support that will hold her in her new found position if she wins the White House."
786,Trump’s position on abortion is to let the states decide
787,It’s too late
788,Josh Shapiro/ Wes Moore 2024
789,"I&#39;m actually crying laughing at the fact people think Kamala&#39;s better than biden. if anything, she&#39;s worse because she also is just as clueless as biden and her awful policies and leadership have significantly led to the severe decline in California&#39;s economy and quality of life. why would we want her to now contribute that failure seen in California to the entirety of the country? WE DO NOT! trump has been the only viable option"
790,hah you wish
791,KAMALA WILL WIN👏👏👏👏
792,🤡
793,Kamala and Buttigieg will win if nominated
794,Number 1 she&#39;s Jamaican American. 🤣
795,"Harris has done nothing of note during her term as VP. Indeed the only big job she was given, securing the southern border she failed at spectacularly. This race is already over."
796,Vice president Barack Obama
797,“She need to replicate that debate’s success” <br><br>You mean the one where she got snappy and everyone everywhere hated tf outta her?
798,Kamala docent have the mental capacity to be the President of the United States.+
799,So this election is going to be turned into everything except the economy and the cost of living
800,Now trump is the old man
801,"I think she suffers the same problem as Clinton, being infamous for her shady policies but putting up the front as lovable teddy-bear charming friendly politician. E.g. Clinton was infamous as Secretary of State during Iraq/Libya but in campaign had this lovey-dovey feminist smiling facade. She was more like Thatcher but pretended to be otherwise. People hate that about democrats, the pretentious farce and masquerade, which is why partly why ppl loved Trump because he said it ‘as it is’, he didn’t mince words or beat around the bush or put up this teddy bear exterior, he was blunt and to the point and didn’t feel elitist or condescending to his demographic."
802,Laughing Kamala - love it! We need someone with a sense of humor.
803,No. Trump got this one in the bag .Go trump.
804,"There is only one major player with enough character and profile to beat Trump with this short notice, Pete Buttigieg. Everyone besides evangelical fascists and MAGA fanatics respect him and knows what he stands for. Harris had 4 years to build a profile and didn&#39;t so unless she has something to pull out of a hat real fast she will not win."
805,Kamala!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
806,Trump is more black than Harris.
807,I’m still voting blue 💙💙💙
808,WSJ must&#39;ve known 30 days ago that this would happen 😂 ... They pulled out the popcorn today and hit &quot;Post&quot;
809,Her smile is scary
810,Trump is too old to run for president!
811,Dont let this left sided prosecutor who jailed the most minority amricans then anyone else she cares about illegal migrants not minorities
812,Kamala Harris was born in 🇺🇲 she&#39;s 💯🇺🇲
813,I just wanna know what has Harris done in her vice presidency?
814,I think they have these video premade but with different titles and they change it as the news changes
815,If they want young voters they need Sanders and AOC for vice.
816,"Kamala has done nothing for the country. She is a shame as a presidential representative, she is lacked of diplomatic tactic, she showed when she first traveled representing America, and travel through central America and the first thing she said while people were cheering : &quot; you are not welcome&quot; not welcome to America, omg what ashamed, then she went back to DC and should reluctant to visit the border during great crisis of people specially children in big numbers crossing the border. The only way she would get ahead in 2024 election would be through outsiders interfering the election because she would be an easy puppet of  the enemies of the US, and of course the inside Socialist."
817,"&quot;Kamala Harris is the poorest choice by the Democrats. Our world is in chaos, and we don&#39;t have time to treat this like a children&#39;s show.&quot;"
818,lol
819,tbh i would love to see a women president
820,Harris not going to be the nominee. So irrelevant video.
821,Kamala vs. Trump in an open debate could get ugly. Imagine Trump preventing yet another woman from reaching the Whitehouse
822,Harris the law enforcer versus Trump the felon.
823,this is satire right?
824,I would vote for Harris over Trump any day.
825,😂
826,if kamala has an advantage with black women why did she lose the primary?
827,Don&#39;t forget the LGBTQ community. She is no homophobe.
828,"Makes no sense, Dems say they want to beat Trump... Bernie can beat Trump, as last polling on it shown... Kamala can&#39;t, as evident..."
829,Kamala isn’t African American - can we just clear that up
830,She has our votes in Texas
831,All Trump has to do is put out ads of her cackling. It will drive EVERYONE crazy.
832,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
833,As a Democrat I don&#39;t know how she is the first choice when Kamala lacks the intellect to run this country.
834,She has no clue she got where she is at today buy laying on her back
835,I&#39;m voting harris
836,Stronger because she can walk.
837,Harris is like a 5 yr old - compared to trump
838,"This is a train wreck , everyone knows how horrible this administration is but we’re gonna watch ."
839,she is not ready
840,WSJ has their own investigators and phones tap 🤳
841,We want Trump... Trump... Trump
842,Vote Kamala Democrat 2024<br><br><br>Please vote Democrat
843,🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂nobody can stand her!!!
844,answer is no
845,"The mission is still to keep Trump from regaining the White House and allowing 2025 to start burrowing into our freedoms. Whoever is chosen to run, that is the mission. And we may now bow our heads and Thank God that we had President Biden as long as we had. His 50 years of service to America should now be celebrated by all of us. He is indeed a great man. Thank you, Joe."
846,Trump 70%<br>Others together 30
847,Looks like Trump will definitely be our next president 👏👏👏
848,Kamal is a breath of fresh air in a such a bleak election year!! THANK YOU!!! 🙏 🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🫶🫶
849,"Kamla is perfect in a laughing contest, nut in American politics $$$"
850,Ride the little harris  yellow bus. Pathetic
851,Harris ain’t it😩
852,KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT 🎉💯🇺🇲
853,It&#39;s between Trump and RFK. Go RFK
854,lol
855,Go for Harris and find a strong male vice president who can complement her weaknesses. I hope and pray for a Democratic victory - with love from Denmark!👍🇩🇰🇩🇰&quot;
856,Go Trump
857,Polls and actual votes don&#39;t matter as long as there&#39;s corrupted electoral college
858,"An ever easier win!<br>Heels up Harris has ZERO CHANCE!!<br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#Trump2024</a><br>🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23maga"">#MAGA</a>"
859,"The Democratic play now is for everyone to get behind Kamala Harris, showing party unity and strength. Do that and the democrats have a very real chance to salvage this. Harris is already getting new dentations on top of the war chest intertied from Biden, so she&#39;s already gaining momentum. Will be interesting (and crucial) to learn who her running mate will be."
860,Who is Harris??
861,She can&#39;t blow half the electorate. So she has no chance
862,She would also make history if elected as the first female president
863,"IMO, Harris is worse if you&#39;re talking about winning. Harris would be a much better president than Biden as a President just due to competence but she doesn&#39;t have his name and popularity. She&#39;s an unknown and Biden is still the incumbent. He&#39;s much more familiar to people so IMO he has the better chance of actually winning."
864,gurrante win for one of the sides
865,Harris cannot win and will not this is fkn laughable 😂
866,WRONG!! 😑 Trump Train’s gonna WIN
867,All we have to do is pronounce her name ka-MAL-ah &amp; they will freak out 😂😂😂🎉🎉
868,"Bye Joe! She will never run, they can’t control her! She can’t control herself! She was and is worst then JOE she made him look and sound smart😒THINK ABOUT THAT 😒she loves yellow school buses 😂😂"
869,😂
870,"She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.<br>That&#39;s my president! 🤡"
871,"Assuming Kamala&#39;s popularity among black voters is going to be a huge mistake, blacks more than anyone want to see strong leadership."
872,The Democrat Party - A cause without a rebel.
873,"kamala is even worse than that living dead was. shes like a joker, am i watching a warner bros trailer? 😂😂"
874,"Even if you love Harris, the comparison to Obama is absolutely ridiculous."
875,She has my vote
876,She’s out
877,Wwg1wga
878,Mouth
879,Harris is shamed to stand next to Trump
880,If that women becomes president ? USA is doomed and so is the west.
881,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
882,Yes she is stronger!!!! Vote Harris 💙 2025🎉
883,I go with God and the American people! Sadly half of America mostly people of color have No Idea who she is!
884,And the tennis match continues: Advantage trump has changed to Advantage Harris
885,Now we have the first DEI hire candidate for President...  Bravo Joe
886,why does anyone think women and people of colour will vote for kamala harris just because she&#39;s a woman of colour?
887,"History is not on the Democrats side here. The last time Democrats kicked out their own incumbent president running for reelection, Democrats lost. Lyndon B. Johnson was running in the primaries in 1968 but was pressured to step down due to low approval ratings. His Vice President Herbert H Humphrey became the Nominee, and he was defeated by Richard Nixon in a close election."
888,Forget policies etc... She could be the first woman POTUS 🎉
889,This country is 90% down! She going shut it down.
890,Kamala  buena desision por president ahora si ganamos
891,What aboutgay man community
892,NO NO AND NO AGAIN 🎉🎉🎉
893,"WSJ, be honest . You made this video before today’s announcement, didn’t you??😂😂"
894,Trump is so old that the LP record album was not even invented until years after his 1946:birth .<br>   He is too old . Older than Grandpa .
895,I hope we can learn about the significance of the passage of time from her some more.
896,The amount of Russian Bots is mental on WSJ
897,"Kamala has NEVER lost an election debate. In 2004 she suprisingly became San Fran&#39;s DA. In 2010 she became Cali&#39;s AG. In 2016 she became senator. Even in 2020, the one people say she &quot;lost&quot;, she was the only one who finagled her way to become VP. So that was a &quot;win&quot; for Kamala.<br><br>In other words: It&#39;s not wise to undestimate Kamala."
898,Nowyou naild it.
899,I bet most of those women polled on abortion think trump wants to outright ban it. Like this and other msm outlets love to lie about.
900,"The DNC should have held a primary, they have secured a loss for themselves no doubt. <br>Also, where is this coming from? Not like people watched the debates and saw for the first time Biden&#39;s problems, he&#39;s had them for years, so why drop out now?"
901,Thats according to some of the Democrats..but lets see.. its not a good idea to underestimate both candidates...
902,TRUE  THAT ABOUT LACKING CHARACTER  ALWAYS  DEPENDS  ON  NAME  CALLING  AND INSULTING IT NEVER STOPS  AND ITS GROUNDLESS AS HIS PENCHANT FOR LYING  PRECEDES  HIM.ITS TATTOOED ON HIS FACE  ITS SO  WELL KNOWN..  IT&#39;LL BE HIS LEGACY  MORE THAN  ANYTHING....LYING.   REPULSIVE TO HAVE TO  HEAR.  AND WATCH  HIS   ARMS FLAIL.
903,Trumps gonna win by a landslide! Good luck from Canada
904,The DNC trying so desperately to hold onto their position yet they won&#39;t give democratic voters who they want. They pushed Bernie out in 2016 and now they do everything to push RFK Jr out even though he&#39;s the only path to victory and polls have shown it. It&#39;s clear that the democratic party would rather keep hold of their billionaire funding and power than put someone into office that would help the American people at the cost of their political donors.
905,Love how they have hidden the coverage of people that had No Idea who Harris is!😅😅😢
906,lol  I REALLY hope Harris vs Trump.  Go Dems!  :P
907,"No one likes Harris no one, the democrat candidate should be Kennedy who has biggest family name of anyone in democrat party but democrats don&#39;t believe in democracy they will choose candidate and not the people and they will lose bad 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
908,"Terrible choice, Hilary was destroyed by trump this is just another rerun of this. Should be bernie"
909,Harris 2024!💙🇺🇸
910,🗳️💙
911,"Kamala could ignite a women-led movement. The Me Too movement has already demonstrated the formidable power of women in standing up for their rights in America.Trump is a threat to women&#39;s rights, and Kamala Harris is the ideal candidate to challenge that threat."
912,The Democrats are finished.
913,WE ARE ALL FLOODING TO ROBERT F KENNEDY jr!
914,If you will be able to talk coherently and not in word salad.
915,she&#39;s polling worse than biden and biden just dropped out
916,I&#39;m amazed at how quickly the media can go from not saying a word about kamala Harris because she was such a poor speaker to championing her as a second Barack Obama.
917,Let&#39;s go Kamala
918,just so everyone knows the like to dislike ratio is almost 50/50!
919,"And imagine, they had this video all ready to go with the drop of the news.  If you think anything &quot;happens&quot; anymore in this country, then you are a fool."
920,If South Park was real life.. 😂
921,STOP saying she is black! African American! She is Jamaican Indian!
922,You don&#39;t need to worry about the white voters you better worry about the black ones we&#39;re not voting for this lady
923,Tulsi Gabbard shut her down in the primaries. Whats kamala going to do. Most people don&#39;t like her
924,Joe was voted to be his party’s nominee but his own party forced him to quit. His own party went against the American voters. Who again is a threat to Democracy? The party of gaslighters!!
925,Internationally <br>Harris is a BIG mistake <br>Not many leaders are going to take her serious
926,"Yes. She’s younger, more coherent and articulate. She will eat him alive at the debate."
927,They know they will not get enough ppl to show up for Joe to do their mail in apparatus and he’s gone down the hillside. Now they can fake enthusiasm around Kamala.
928,"Kamala Harris was saying this week how Biden is her man for the President, which destroys her credibility entirely."
929,Kamala is not right for the job
930,I don”t know about you but I ain’t getting on that yellow school bus!
931,Democrats FLOODING to vote INDEPENDENT! RF Kennedy Jr!
932,She is going to lose bigly.  LOL.
933,A pet rock is a better choice then orange con- artist who got his money from daddy and image from the media.
934,Four hours ago I was not going to vote for the 1st time in my being able to vote history… Now the choice is clear.
935,Absolutely:  No!
936,I want the bumper sticker now - From Willie Brown to the White House!!!!
937,Landslide victory for Trump
938,WSJ already had this in the chamber I see 😂
939,🤣
940,Let&#39;s go Brandy
941,As an independent voter the Democratic Party has not been honest.
942,What can be unburdened by.. What has been the worst VP in history 😂
943,"This woman insulted everyone&#39;s intelligence weeks ago saying Biden should continue to run. Are you really considering her now? How quickly people forget, smh."
944,Kind of hard to vote for abortion when you can’t put groceries on the table…
945,When does the cackling start?
946,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=88"">1:28</a> &quot;Expect Harris to invoked more excitement from black voters&quot;....wow they really think we are that stupid. Dangle Kamala in front of us and we&#39;ll flock 😡"
947,She as much as a disaster as Biden. This is a lay up for Trump. Hillary 2.0.
948,Black people voting for Trump dont fall for this propaganda
949,NO NO AND NO AGAIN 🎉🎉🎉🎉
950,"As for a country, we are so F!!!!!"
951,Easy win for Trump
952,A NAME KAMALA IS INDIAN NAME. WE INDIAN ARE NOT BLACK.
953,Strong debator? Kamilian got face stomped by Tulsi Gabbard and didn&#39;t even make it to the primaries.
954,To compare her to Obama is extremely offensive to Obama. He’s an amazing speaker and incredibly charismatic while she is neither of those things.
955,Kamila &amp; Pete 2024
956,Nonsense from end to another.  Rest of the world laughs their sleeves off 🫣🤪
957,😂😂😂😂😂😂
958,"The Dems won&#39;t pick a different candidate than Harris because any candidate other than her won&#39;t be able to access the war chest of funds that the Biden/Harris campaign has accumulated.  But, because Harris is part of the Biden/Harris campaign, the law allows her to have full use of those millions of dollars.  Any other candidate would have to start from scratch.<br><br>Politically, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly makes the most sense as the VP candidate:<br><br>1. He&#39;s from a very key swing state that he could deliver to the Democrats<br>2. He&#39;s &quot;squeaky clean&quot; in terms of political baggage, unlike all the other contenders who have various kinds of political baggage<br>3. He&#39;s a sympathetic figure because of his wife&#39;s ordeal<br>4. He has an admired background as an astronaut<br>5. His replacement would be named by Arizona&#39;s Democratic governor, thereby keeping that Senate seat on the Democratic side of the aisle.<br><br>Trump is terrified of Harris because she&#39;s a courtroom-experienced prosecuting attorney and will shred felon Trump in debates."
959,I just imagine she was probably in a Hookah lounge somewhere vibing and found the news out like we did
960,"If you&#39;re voting because of someone&#39;s gender or race your voting rights need taken, just saying. This isn&#39;t the prom..."
961,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
962,She is not African American
963,Strong? 🫥
964,A quitter endorses a loser. Nice.
965,"For the benefit of those who don&#39;t remember or aren&#39;t even aware, Harris was at the very bottom of the list for the 2020 Democratic nomination.  How exactly can her handlers possibly elevate her over Trump in any convincing capacity?"
966,It&#39;s so incredible how some media is clearly Democrat and how other is just Republican.
967,Let me quess. There will be a person with the last name Obama involved.  🤨
968,She will destroy Tnutt on a debate stage!!! IF they fact check ALL his lies when he opens his mouth he won&#39;t have a chance!
969,Harris Is Racist towards Disabled Americans and Disabled Veterans.
970,All in on Harris! Let’s go!
971,"Bumpy must be shaking in his boots, Harris is going to wipe the floor with bumpy, see a bump"
972,WSJ is trying soooo hard to gaslight us about Kamala
973,Trump 100%
974,I love her!
975,This is literally just the boys tv show at this point what is going on America
976,"The Goons Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers and Michael Bentine could not have written a finer comedy script than this 😂😂😂"
977,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#TRUMP2024</a> SHE&#39;S BEEN TERRIBLE"
978,She is even worse
979,Michelle Obama should run instead.
980,"Her own state of california despises her and the lowest VP ratings in history…lol. Sure, she’s your winner! She talks about character? Mayor Willie Brown would like to have a chat!"
981,Kamala Haris has one job to do is to “open US borders from East to West and from north to south”
982,Kamala wil be the one certifying the election. She can jusy block electoral votes and declare herself the winner.
983,Harris? Ehm....No.
984,Kamala Harris can do it!??<br>TRUMP WAS THE WORSE PRESIDENT EVER!!!
985,Kamala cannot win. Biden was a winnable candidate. I expect Chuck Schumer can help here… otherwise some outsiders like Marc Cuban.
986,I wouldn&#39;t let her mow my lawn. LITERALLY!
987,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=480"">8:00</a> Why does he refer to black people as “african americans” and white coloured people as “white people” at least latinos being latino makes sense"
988,Su trabajo en 4  años   00000000 kamala  que??
989,"Bye, bye, Trump. The race is over."
990,"The significance of the passage of time, The passage of time is significant, The time is significant of the passage."
991,She will not win. All she does is lie
992,She&#39;s not a criminal 😂
993,So Trump can include not only speaking to terminating the Constitution but also about almost being terminated himself.<br><br>Meanwhile Kamala has to show she can handle immigration properly which is big with voters.
994,"Lol, can&#39;t imagine her sitting across the table of Putin,  or leadership of Iraq, Iran, etc..... they will just ignore her, and continue whatever they want to do"
995,I think her VP Pick will absolutely be the make of break decision . Mark Kelly would be an exceptional pick
996,"Make sure to send more mail-in votes, including those from Marsh, or Democrats will be disappointed"
997,Kamala will be the same as crooked Biden. She will ruin this country. Trump is the way to go.
998,THE QUESTION IS THAT WHO WILL SAVE AND BRING THE USA OUT OF THE DARK NIGHT OF DECLINING ECONOMY AND KAMALA OR MICHELLE OBAMA CAN NOT ANSWER IT!!!
999,Everybody is surprised about this video<br>They don&#39;t realize that his exit was planned before he got covid and thought that he was sharp as tack still believing MSM
1000,I never comment on WSJ posts because Murdoch owns the paper and it is a rag today. BUT it is time to get rid of Trump now that it is time for FACTS. Remember January 6th all you crazed right wingers? Remember what Mitch McConnell said? Remember what Kevin McCarthy said?
1001,White women even the liberal ones are not putting her in the white house before they put their own in there. and just for teh record she is NOT African American
1002,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=98"">1:38</a> &quot;as an African American woman&quot;...didn&#39;t she have Indian roots? Simple google search can confirm her parents are from India. Abysmal journalism.<br><br>Does the narrative require her to be black in order to appeal to black voters? Can&#39;t she appeal to them on the basis of...you know...her manifesto?"
1003,"Harris cannot form a coherent sentence, how can she be president?"
1004,"The party who was for &quot;saving democracy&quot; just threw it all away to get what they wanted. If the election is based on personalities, Harris doesn&#39;t have one. She cackles all the time, she treats adults like babies, she can&#39;t stop raving about electric school busses and Venn diagrams, and she goes through staff members only second to the press announcing a new roll out of her."
1005,Everyone is saying &quot;WSJ must have a bunch of scenarios prepared for alternate timelines!&quot;<br>Or maybe they are part of the deep state media and they KNEW that Biden would drop out
1006,I will vote for Kamala
1007,RFK JR lasted longer in this race than biden
1008,Another black president so soon? Won’t the country explode?
1009,"Waw they had this report all ready !!  I guess now Biden will be prosecuted for arming the genocide and Stealing American tax dollars to finance it.? <br>. all Kamala needs now is a BlackRock ¨buddy¨ and a stadium full of AIPAC donors and she may just ¨win¨  ... for them...   <br>Trump already has BlackStone backing him and Aipac love him since he moved the Embassy to Jerusalem, and has  vowed to back the total Anexation of the West Bank and finish the Job in Gaza iff he wins,, ¨more $$ and weapons for Israel¨,, higher housing prices,, its a win win for the American Deep state ..again . Maybe iff Kamala promises to finance the Bengurion Canal, could be enough.?."
1010,A vote for Biden was already a vote for Harris.     I&#39;m not sure Harris has any better chance then Biden really.  😊
1011,"bro they produce this before, thats normal in journalistics."
1012,A vote for Biden was already a vote for Harris.     I&#39;m not sure Harris has any better chance then Biden really.
1013,Most people are saying they don&#39;t want Harris for president she has not done anything for our country
1014,Kamala is not a decision maker like trump
1015,She should pick Joe to be her vice president
1016,It’s tragic that CNN MSNBC et al were willing to cover for Biden’s cognitive collapse.   Kama was willing to cover up the worse than Watergate Biden cover up with failed policies dangerous border. Terrible
1017,The so-called Democrat party has just pit in the face of Democrat primary voters.
1018,A Trump and Harris Debate?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😉
1019,KAMALA CONTINUES THE POLICY TO DESTROY THE USA!!!!
1020,The worst thing the Dems can do now is show disunity.
1021,Michele Obama for President or Vice President!
1022,Let’s do this Kamala ❤
1023,If European could vote Trump would win hands down! <br>We want Trump !!
1024,maybe is kamala didnt speak to people like 4 year olds people would like her more
1025,Kamala Harris is much worse.
1026,Laffen Kamala gonna lose bad
1027,A lot of Haters in this chat.. Yall didn’t want this smoke with Kamala.. A well spoken Prosecutor vs a self centered convict 😂😂😂😂😂
1028,"She&#39;s got women, youth, people of color, people of different religions, persuasions, genders, s*xual preferences, unions, seniors.  Hmmm... she&#39;ll be okay"
1029,😂😂😂
1030,She is extremely weak.  No experience and she has done nothing.  Trump was a very strong and extremely successful president.  What is the platform going to be?  I can laugh more than President Trump.
1031,Vote Trump <br>And all will be ok
1032,This is just wrong. She doesn&#39;t have young voters. She gets black minorities and a some women (if they&#39;re that pathetic and simply look for that in a candidate). Also minorities by definition are small amount of people and can&#39;t win as majorities. I know you want to discount the white population for your minoritarian bigotry and bias but a) that&#39;s not possible and b) the majority matters more as they are most of the country and most affected.
1033,kamala is too woke.  like claudine gay.
1034,He can go ahead and take that toilet brush with him
1035,the democratics have lost as to many believe a women cannot run the country
1036,All in for Kamala Harris. Let’s go!!!
1037,Can y&#39;all spend more time on the independent candidates?
1038,"Just make it about abortion #1, and Kamala will win. Bring Whitmoore as vice president, and make it an pro-choice ticket"
1039,Harris is awful
1040,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1041,Comparing Harris to Obama? 😂😂😂
1042,Biden was a big Joke and she will be a bigger joke
1043,Is WSJ state media?
1044,"Kamala, climbing her way to the top on her knees!"
1045,Let’s go

1048,و ليست حتى بيضاء لهزيمة ترمب هنا يجب التفكير جيدا بتزوير الانتخابات لن ينفع حتى تحيز المجمع الانتخابي😂
1049,No. Kamala is absolutely terrible
1050,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1051,A dead raccoon has more chance against Trump than DEI hire Harris.
1052,I vote Harris before I vote felon.

1055,lies. no one is excited by kamala.
1056,harris should withdraw to do what&#39;s best for democracy.  she will lose to trump.  we need someone who can win.
1057,San Francisco City mayor maybe a good fit for her to run for.
1058,tbh...Kamala jumping in for Biden in case Biden&#39;s age getting the better of him probably has already been strategically anticipated very early on. Kamala as a colored woman was probably the best kanidate to choose in order to ensure Bidens work in the white house to be passed on to. I believe Biden was smart enough to understand that his clock was ticking and Kamala serves as the ideal safty net.
1059,"Okay, that&#39;s it. I&#39;m in a blue state, but I&#39;m going to vote anyways.."
1060,No she&#39;s not. Only chance the DNC has is having an open convention and picking the best candidate. Harris has just as low approval numbers as Biden.
1061,I rather vote for Kanye west than Kamala  Harris
1062,Omg!   Her??  🤮
1063,This is a debate between a toddler and a prosecutor. She will destroy him in first debate.
1064,"…… I would hope if Kamala is nominated she pics anyone other than Robert Kennedy … he hasn’t the proper disposition for the job … he’d make a great talking head on a number of news entertainment networks … CNN , Fox , MSNBC , TYT etc. ….."
1065,"Kamala Harris will win the 2024 presidential election race!!! She&#39;ll be the first woman elected president, if she wins the 2024 presidential election race!!! Vote for Kamala Harris and vote Democrat!!! 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙!!!"
1066,Comes over as inauthentic. Another weak candidate.
1067,Kamala❓️ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1068,"Kamala Harris, with the background of the prosecution, is prosecuting Trump!!!!<br>Trump&#39;s strengths:<br>Excellence in fundraising for his election campaign<br>He excelled in collecting the Latin votes<br>He excelled in Florida and Texas<br>A populist who relies on excitement and personality killing <br>Trump&#39;s weaknesses<br>*Without academic background, the institution relies on consultants<br>*A criminal newspaper full of convictions and accusations<br>*Loss of popular votes for two sessions<br>*There is a global impact on his victory, especially in the European Union, China and the Middle East<br>*A suspicious relationship with Putin<br>*Feud with feminist rights associations!!!<br>+The Democratic campaign must highlight Biden&#39;s patriotic role in stepping down due to health reasons and not for fear of losing the elections <br>Tax file <br>Immigration file<br>Russian intervention<br>Disqualification based on Trump&#39;s criminal record<br>Continued support for the campaign from the Clinton family and the Obama family<br>And the Biden family!!!"
1069,Koom-ah-la&#39;s barely even black.  Most American blacks aren&#39;t all black.  75-80% at most.  Then she&#39;s half Indian.  She&#39;s only about 30-35% black.  She&#39;s a Punjabi.  Her policies as AG in California put away more blacks than anyone.
1070,Yeah she doesn&#39;t she&#39;s gonna get washed
1071,"My sister knows people who have personally dined with Kamala Harris in Sacramento. If you’ve ever seen the scene in Sweet November (Keanu Reeves stars in it) where the boss demeans the waitress… let’s just say, Kamala Harris was the boss except, she went a step further and mentioned she was going to get the waitress fired. Kamala might have changed since then and everyone has a right to change their ways. It’s just something to keep in mind."
1072,Here comes the full media support to prop her up.
1073,Kamala should just call him a lier. Every time he says something she could say “you are lying again”!<br>She does not have to prove he is a lier like he does not have to prove it is a truth. <br>Who will<br>Most people believe? Kamala of course. <br>Trump has been proven to be a lier. His history is lying. <br>He can’t remember any details so he always lies.
1074,"Harris has no leadership ability.  This is why she was the first to drop out of the 2020 democrat primary.  Also, most people have grown tired of the liberal identity politics.  Harris is incapable of being the commander in chief."
1075,In other words (and what WSJ will never say in plain terms): diversity hire
1076,"Im a black man.  If Harris becomes president, this Country is in grave trouble.  I DONT CARE what color she is.  No way in any situation is this woman fit to run anything.   Get out and vote people!!"
1077,Laughable since she has known Biden’s condition.
1078,Stop targeting young impressionable people who don&#39;t know any better
1079,Kamala isn&#39;t African she&#39;s Indian
1080,Ohhhh she’s cooked 💀
1081,Ha Ha Ha. You don’t  Have it … now it’s going to get worse🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🤢🤢🤮
1082,REPARATIONS FOR THE LINEAGE OF SLAVES IS HARRIS ONLY CHANCE TO WIN. SHE DO AND SHE WILL BE THE MOST HISTORICAL PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY ALONG WITH LINCOLN. SHE DON&#39;T APPROVE REPARATIONS SHE WILL BE ANOTHER HILLARY CLINTON. SHE WILL RUN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND NEVER WIN
1083,"She´s not a female Obama, lets get that clear.<br><br>If she can make a name of herself then she could be the first female black president that America get to experience."
1084,What has she done as Vice President
1085,I wonder what will now happen to all the anti-Biden ads and the Hunter Biden obsession!
1086,"Love and best wishes always to President Biden. I am crestfallen that he&#39;s stepped down. Why can&#39;t a role be made for him to be a &quot;consultant&quot; to the new administration, so that he can pass on and finish what he&#39;s started? Why not make a special role for him this time, due to the unique situation? I think it would make the electorate feel more inclined to stick with the Dems!  And hopefully bring over many more voters to them, as well.  (I&#39;m a Canadian, so am not sure if something like that has ever been done... but Joe could make it happen while he&#39;s still in the chair and has full immunity to, well, practically anything! ;)"
1087,Trump will win. Bet on it.
1088,I will be voting for her.
1089,Trump won already lol Kamala is not liked lol what a joke
1090,I&#39;ll Write In Biden
1091,TYSON for president
1092,"Yah well she will never beat Trump, the Democrats are Doomed For This Coming November, And Biden didn&#39;t have a choice but to step down, regarding his speech against Trump at the Presidential Debate, then at the NATO Summit, he really screwed up big time, end of story!"
1093,Trump...got this.     She 🤪  crazy....😅😅😅😅
1094,You can&#39;t run a campaign on abortion. <br>Much bigger things to worry about
1095,Lies
1096,LOL🤣🤣🤣

1100,"Women, &quot;people of color&quot; and young voters are already turned off by Trump ..<br><br>They need to find a more moderate candidate to win over the swing voters"
1101,Wall Street now scrambles to ensure Democratic voters have no say in who their nominee is.
1102,Before she became vp she run for president and got what 200 votes? <br>See on there understanding she is now popular because................<br>Who knows
1103,Easy win for TRUMP if democrats was smart they should use THE KENNEDY Vs TRUMP but a Women is so weak specially against TRUMP who is a Beast
1104,What A Joke… Space &amp; Time? Coconut Trees? Little Yellow School Buses… 😂😂😂😂
1105,3 months to the presidential election is A MILLION YEARS in the modern social media era.... You don.t need to wait for the Pony express or the telegraph to introduce a new candidate!! Times have changed....
1106,Kamala is smarter the Trump.  Trump is wants taxpayers money for his family.  Trump couldn&#39;t stand up to Kamala.
1107,TRUMP ❤
1108,Are we better off now than we were 4 years ago?
1109,She&#39;s soo strong that she lost to Biden in the primaries.
1110,If Hilary didn’t win what makes you think Kamala will 😭
1111,"I don&#39;t she can classify as a full on black woman, indian and jamaican parents don&#39;t translate to african american to me. Something about having someone that isn&#39;t full on american with american roots doesn&#39;t sit right with me."
1112,As an independent the &quot;more of the same&quot; from the Democrats is not going to work this election.  Too much &quot;woke DEI&quot; policies over real policies to help all Americans is needed.
1113,Stepping down from power itself is a remarkable act. This could surprisingly turn the tables and be disadvantageous for Trump.
1114,"I want Multiculturalism, not whatever <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=191"">3:11</a> is"
1115,"SHE does not have a chance. she was never popular. even when she ran as President,  You can&#39;t say racism Obama already won. Putting in a female from the Party that claimed they could not define what a woman is is hypocritical at the least. This election is about issues. Peroid."
1116,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=72"">1:12</a> The Nicest Way I Can Put This Is Harris Is Wrong Cause They Already Have The Right To Do What She Says That They Don&#39;t Have The Right To Do."
1117,Pete Buttigieg should be the Vice President
1118,💙 <b>Raskin-Moskowitz 2024</b> 💙
1119,Trump 2024
1120,Media will paint her as the candidate but  she is FAF. Media won’t show tulsi burning Harris on her dishonest record as a prosecutor.
1121,last time she ran for president she got 0 votes from her own district
1122,"If they give the nomination the Kamala, I don&#39;t even think they&#39;re trying to win. Kamala might appeal to hardcore democrats but she doesn&#39;t to moderates which is who you will need to convince if you want to win. If she got it before the debate she would have had a chance but a lot of moderates have already spent the last month coping about Trump and his new platform which is relatively moderate. Kamala won&#39;t swing those voters back."
1123,"HUH? It has been frequently commented in the media that Ukraine is on shakey grounds because Biden was very pro-Ukraine, Trump appears to be very anti-Ukraine pro-Russia.<br>However:<br>- When 300 (yes, only 300) &quot;little green men&quot; invaded Crimea, President Obama and VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN, ordered Ukraine to stand-down so as to avoid &quot;Russian escalation&quot;.<br>- At the beginning of the war, his administration was reluctant to send Ukraine even javelin anti-tank arms.<br>- The US was importing about 5-10% of its oil from Russia. Initially Biden was reluctant to put sanctions of Russian gas and oil, lest it increase the price of gasoline by 10-cents a gallon. Indeed, a few months ago, Secretary of Defense Austin stated that Ukraine should not hit Russian oil depots lest it raise the price of gas. (Actually, doing so DECREASES the price of oil because Russia has to export more oil to compensate losses.)<br>- The US, and it told its allies, not to send F-16s to Ukraine.<br>  The F-16s it will send are 1976 versions, a radar range of 30  miles to Russian plane radar ranges of 300 miles and able to fire 100 miles from target.<br>- The Biden administration has imposed &quot;Russian Safe Zones&quot; whereby Russia can send missiles to bomb apartments, schools and hospitals, but Ukraine can not hit back.<br>- US politicians keep stating that the US has given over $200 billion in aid to Ukraine. However, it was previously $44.8 billion but only HALF has been delivered. In the $90 billion military package, $61 billion was for Ukraine, but $13.7 billion was to purchase US weapons ($2-7 billion of which was outdated expired 1995 weapon junk) and $13 billion to purchase non-US weapons, (e.g. Germany ballistics that won&#39;t be available until 2027).<br>     DOES ANYONE HAVE ACTUAL FIGURES OF WHAT THE US BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS ACTUALLY DELIVERED vs WHAT THE US HAS PROMISED?"
1124,"And thus the propaganda machine begins for Kamala, just like it had for saying Joe is mentally fit to be president."
1125,"If she wins, males will be second-class citizens. She has the reputation for sending a lot of people to jail then with the immigrants and promoting being gay. We all love women and give people of color a chance. But this is running a country, not charity hiring of DEI. Go Trump!"
1126,Lots of Trump supporters in the comments feeling a little threatened by this turn of events it seems. As do the Russian and Chinese bots.
1127,Hariss can’t run Dunkin Donut shop how can she trying to run USA 🇺🇸
1128,Let&#39;s go Harris
1129,Kamala Harris is going to be the next President of the United States. Trump is going to lose. Prepare for it.
1130,She hasn’t won the nomination yet?
1131,LOOOOOOOOLL SINCE WHEN WAS KAMALA EVER AN OPTION
1132,How is Kamala black? Don&#39;t Americans have eyes?
1133,The left have divided black women from black men and you think black men are going to line up and vote for her? Lol
1134,"Just another puppet of globalists, mega-donors and lobbyists."
1135,"Will she pick Hillary Clinton? I have a strong feeling, but hillary was busted bad by Trump before."
1136,She’s not electable a joke by the democrats
1137,Since they’re going to lose anyway…they should run Hillary again. It would be fun to watch
1138,She has absolutely zero chance
1139,Harris? You devil&#39;s make us god fearing people make me laugh uncontrollable 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Trump 2024!
1140,It’s so racist to vote for someone just for his/her skin color.
1141,Hmmm interesting how this came out almost exactly as biden announced he&#39;s out....almost like they planned it.
1142,Donald Trump is the truth
1143,"Kamala harris is not black, she is Jamaican indian. Stop insulting the blacks by calling her black."
1144,This would be too good to be true LOL
1145,Harris is not a great candidate.
1146,"She is so bad, she shouldn&#39;t even be in that race. There are plenty of much better candidates. But the party has an history of not understanding the people&#39;s feelings. They chose H. Clinton and didn&#39;t realized that everybody hated her. And everybody still does."
1147,Nah it’s over. <br><br>Never mind who you like more but a vice president against someone who already served as president. <br><br>It’s over.
1148,"She&#39;s destroyed the border intentionally, just by being missing in action!!! A lazy no-show!!! The democrat party should forfeit simply based on not allowing another vote, so what they&#39;re doing now is switching things up against democrats wishes. Not that most democrats would dare vote anyone other than (D)!!! I&#39;m going by results!!! Record!!! THAT&#39;S what affects my life, and I&#39;m one of the millions who rose out of poverty while Trump was in office. I was destroyed during geriatric genocide Joe!!! Suddenly Kamala is WONDERFUL, what a phony party!!! A laugh and a half!!! Their not giving their constituents the choice, typical democrat party deciding FOR them!!! How do they expect to transfer cauffers and funding, this late in the game!? They break all the rules, after the assassination attempt failed this is all they could succumb to. They shoved Biden in through hatred and it came right back around at them."
1149,I&#39;d rather vote for Biden in his current state than Harris.
1150,&quot;No-one knows how to prosecute Trump more than Kamala Harris&quot; - yep - like she withheld a statement proving an accused was innocent when California DA
1151,"Lol, Kamala? Stronger than Trump? It&#39;s already OVER. It&#39;s been over since the first debate between Trump and Biden but Kamala is so unfavorable that she will never win the Presidential election. She&#39;s worse than Biden is."
1152,"This is Disastrous ! God Save America to MAGA! OMG you people didn’t think Trump would survive after the attack , so you WSJ team wanted Trump dead on that day ? This shows how cheap you are ?"
1153,This video was uploaded 2 hours ago and already has 4700+ votes down. I think it says a lot!
1154,Respect ❤ button for Joe Biden. Imagine how desperate Trump was for power. Thanku Joe. Amazing and always will love him. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1155,Trump has not laid out an agenda or policy except revenge and the border crisis.
1156,LOL - the only worst one than Biden is Harris.
1157,KAMALA as President. LOL. JUST LOL. Lets just make a capybara president.
1158,This is a garbage interview.
1159,Respect ❤ button for Joe Biden. Imagine how desperate Trump was for power. Thanku Joe. Amazing and always will love him. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1160,Harris 되면 미국은 망할 것이다
1161,"TRUMP all the way, this is that president AMERICA needs."
1162,This is nonsense honestly. Kamala Harris can’t even win a debate with a mirror. The narrative that the policies of Biden/Harris are in any way good for this country is idiotic. Look at the border. God bless America 🇺🇸
1163,Kamala Harris will never be my president
1164,Trump V Harris Debate???<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1165,<b><i>TRUMP 2024  🦅🇺🇸</i></b>
1166,Cackling Kamala the Cop? Willie Brown&#39;s girlfriend? No thanks!!!!

1170,Are school buses yellow?
1171,"She becomes president. Just kill me, Russia."
1172,Go Blue we can do this!
1173,Keep in mind she was never democratically chosen.
1174,She’s nothing
1175,Trump is going to clean her clock.
1176,VP short list?

1181,Noooooooooo👎👎👎👎👎👎
1182,She is a threat to the United States!
1183,Scared for trump. Assasination attempt and/ jail.. Harris cant beat Trump
1184,Harris is the next U.S. President!😊
1185,"This administration has been a joke. Biden is a walking cadaver and Kamala Harris  is essentially a word salad. Gen Z deserves a change, vote Trump and give him a chance"
1186,"I don&#39;t understand why everyone is upset about her being a candidate, there isn&#39;t really any evidence showing that she would be a complete failure to America? can someone explain to me why everyone is upset about her or is it just because misogynistic men annoyed?"
1187,The copium is real in this video
1188,WSJ on some wishful thinking right here.
1189,She did such a bad job at the border now shes going to try to run the country?
1190,This one will fail so bad . Don’t use the black card the wrong way
1191,SICK OF HARRIS...a DEI hire!
1192,"With the focus on &#39;she is of color thus attracts people of color&#39; you say nothing. I want viewpoints, policies, proposals."
1193,Go Kamala!!!
1194,She is a threat to the United States!
1195,Now it&#39;s the Prosecutor vs. The Criminal &lt;&lt; USA USA 🇺🇸
1196,I will pull for her but its hard when White America thinks a President should be white...
1197,"If Kamala was any good, they would have dumped Biden ages ago.."
1198,"In the news Biden now says Bear will replace him as the New Democrats candidate,by the way bear is my dog I,m so proud of him !"
1199,"Harris has too much negative legal baggage from her time in California especially with Black men who she unfairly prosecuted. She was for putting Black parents (almost all would be poor women) in jail if their children were truant too many times (as if these poor Black women had control over their fatherless children). She has the baggage of an affair with a man who could help her to the top. In fact, her rap sheet is a gift to the GOP."

1202,"Трамп уже победил, у WSJ наверняка заготовлено видео и на этот случай 😂"
1203,why all i hear is kids roasting eachother instead of talking about the country and citizens 😵‍💫
1204,We have try a woman president these time and I believe woman do better than the men for president

1206,Harris came in 2nd to LAST in the DNC primaries for the 2020 election. How is she &quot;the best choice&quot;?
1207,"If Harris doesn&#39;t put her ideologies closer to the center, she can&#39;t win."
1208,"Thank You Joe!! You saved us from Covid, Trump &amp; Facism. Thank you Joe❤❤"
1209,Trump will swallow the whole dem party and u guys talking about kamala huh. <br>Go trump❤
1210,May the best man win ..and may God bless and keep the one He chooses!
1211,Indo-Jamaican-American Camala Harris.
1212,What I read in Wikipedia is that she come from Indian mother and Jamaican father . She is not Afro-american
1213,HAAA HAAA hAAAA Hilarious
1214,Prosecutor vs Convicted Felon. WWE couldn&#39;t have written a better script😂
1215,It been said to me the winning Trump strategy is to get Kamala to cackle!
1216,Trump does have the potential to be our next president. Harris is 100% wrong.
1217,😂Poor orange man they are going to squeeze him
1218,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=500"">8:20</a> I mean yeah, but I think that&#39;s a really high bar for Kamala to reach. Obama was one of the best orators run for president we&#39;ve ever had."
1219,Trump will still win hands down!
1220,She’ll lose Blacks People don’t want her
1221,Pamela cant carry nothing..she is useless.. she was a token. wake up people.
1222,There will never be a woman president
1223,Harris is not an African-American women
1224,She is not strong enough to be the first woman president. Being the first of any field requires one to be the absolute best. Hillary wasn&#39;t the one and neither is Kamala.
1225,Can WSJ say anything else?
1226,"Nothing, absolutely nothing can remain of this administration. We see you now, with irrefutable proof and what many consider divine intervention. THEY ARE DONE"
1227,LOl what AJoke she does nothing why would anyone want to vote for anyone that has been lying to the American people about Biden what else has she lied about she is very good at it
1228,Kamala Harris vs 80&#39;s WWF wrestler Kamala!!! The epic battles of the Kamalas. There can be only one KAMALA!!!
1229,She is no African American; she is Indian origin woman.
1230,FIRST FEMALE /BLACK PRESIDENT&gt;  GO KAMALA.
1231,"Well, they tried everything and once the assasination attempt failed, they had to try something else."
1232,Does Kamala have the keys? If not she&#39;ll will never have the keys to the White House. This is big money lobbyists and behind closed doors billionaires pushing out Biden. Also does this create legal contentions? I wonder where her policy will be on raising taxes on the wealthy.
1233,They really said Kamala channels the candidate characteristics and features of Obama 😂
1234,Hysterical laughter of hers is frightening though
1235,"More propaganda from the Dems! <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/UvgfY_vqE92T29sPvqiAkAU""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/YvgfY-LIBpjChgHKyYCQBg""></a>"
1236,Imagine Nikki being able to accomplish anything
1237,The Country has already decided!🇺🇸The Democrats can pick whoever they want! They should start planning on 2028🤫🥱
1238,I have no seen no one who voted for Kamala for president! that&#39;s the only way she would get the nomination by the party picking there puppet and not the people! its wrong!
1239,RFKJr????
1240,Kamala❤❤❤
1241,Not Really. She&#39;s just Joe Biden 2.0.
1242,No she&#39;s Not...<br>Her position on Not doing anything for Black people will bite her.<br>Her position on reparations will bite her.<br>Biden lost the black vote and she will not profit from being lame duck president.....
1243,no chance i am still voting for trump nothing going to stop donald trump
1244,She will win. This just made me excited to vote as a citizen and democrat! First female president let’s go!
1245,She will perform significantly worse. That Harley Quinn/Joker laugh makes her so instantly unlikeable. I think Michelle Obama could win
1246,Hows that border being taken care of by Hiddening Harris..where is she everyday.
1247,She will lose too. She’s just another puppet being endorsed by a guy not mentally fit to serve
1248,"The democratic party is in complete disarray, Biden is officially worst than Jimmy Carter"
1249,💙
1250,VP Harris can win against Trump. She has the women and people of colour behind her.
1251,Vote blue!!
1252,"Are you all on drugs really,  the cheating must be ready, she is no Obama"
1253,Now to watch the &quot;democratic&quot; process of selecting the Democratic Party candidate for president...the power elite (mystery process and all) at work!
1254,She is a joke
1255,Trump 2024❤❤❤❤❤
1256,Harris is not Black. She is Indian
1257,"No way I,m voting for her"
1258,A very strong heart felt Thank you Mr. President!
1259,"Yeah as a black man, i&#39;m definitely voting for Trump now 😂😂"
1260,Trump is definitely going to prison in 2025
1261,What a fool anyone would be to vote for Pamela Nitwit Harris. God protect from Evil that has been put upon..
1262,"Biden&#39;s endorsement of cackling Kamala means very little to voters. She&#39;s a horrible V.P. so why would anyone expect anything different of her as the president?<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/UvgfY_vqE92T29sPvqiAkAU""></a>"

1265,So Dems have NO candidate basically?
1266,Go Trump!
1267,Putting Harris on the ticket is admitting defeat. The Dems rather lose and keep its power structure than to win and overhaul it. Thats dangerous.
1268,Biden just beat Trump twice. Once by stepping in and now by stepping out
1269,Didn’t the democrats throw her out of the primary a while back?
1270,"Forget Polls...let&#39;s get busy folks. The DNC screwed us and we&#39;re behind the 8-ball. Wish Clyburn would stay outta this campaign. He was the reason why we had to settle for Biden, although Joe wound up delivering more than expected. Can we stop playing it safe? This is an opportunity."
1271,"The democratic circus continues.  With all due respect thou, anybody is better than Joe Biden.  That man is palliative.  This is not a joke."
1272,REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A FIRST FEMALE BLACK PRESIDENT!!! JUSTICE FOR KAMALA!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
1273,Harris can only scare us 😳👎🏽
1274,A debate between Harris and tRump! Let&#39;s do it!!!
1275,"If she chooses a good vicepresident candidate, it is possible!"
1276,"I think Biden, in this condition right now, had more chance than Kamala."
1277,Interesting
1278,If the DNC doesn’t elect Kennedy I will NEVER RETURN BACK TO BEING A DEMOCRAT
1279,This lady is talking sbout someones character is hilarious
1280,Lol. No. Voting Green Party here in PA.
1281,LET&#39;S GO BLUE 💙 HARRIS!! GOD GOT YOU PRESIDENT HARRIS 🙏 🙌
1282,can&#39;t wait for Harris to shred trump on stage like Jessica Pearson in suits! haha can&#39;t wait to watch!

1285,WSJ was prepared 😂 illuminati
1286,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=43"">0:43</a> Racist"
1287,"Kamala Harris is not the best option to replace Biden, someone like the governor Gavin Newsom, he’s young, charismatic - woman will love him and he’s a guy’s guy, he will most likely defeat Trump.<br><br>Unfortunately due to current political climate sparked by Trump’s Republican Party, America will most likely not want put as the first female president a woman of color, Kamal will need to do a lot of work, she’s just not popular and often comes off as having an attitude of sorts, a bit snobbish (not saying she is), <br><br>She will need to somehow reconnect and reinvent herself with American voters, especially white men."
1288,Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris ripped a law firm’s work on a controversial plea deal involving deep-pocketed pedophile Jeffrey Epstein — the same day she took money from some of its attorneys.
1289,WE NEED MICHELLE OBAMA
1290,Wishful thinking 😂
1291,Alll i can about Black People stands about Harris is &quot;Juicy Smolliet&quot;.
1292,"I believe in Harris, hope people realize she can do the job! I truly hope she wipes the floor with Trump!"
1293,We want Michelle Obama!!!
1294,She is Indian American...Not African American. Get your facts straight. <br><br>Women&#39;s rights mean nothing when the government is making sweeping moves to remove ALL citizen&#39;s rights with digital identities.
1295,"The Dems and the Press should be ashamed of themselves!!!  I am angry but not so much I would let my country become a dictatorship!!! Because I am aware of the high stakes, I will still vote blue.  I am only voting Blue to save our Democracy!  I will respect President Biden&#39;s decision to step down. I will support VP Kamala Harris!   I look forward to hearing from President Biden in his own words.  President Biden deserves way more respect than what he has been getting!!!  America has a lot to thank him for!  History will be kind to President Biden!  He has been one our better presidents!"
1296,They only dropped this video because Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Kamala.
1297,We need a leader who leads the young people and old people together not just old demented politicians who want to be respected like an old senile who has already surpassed their prime time.
1298,Black women are not checking for K.H. like that! She speaks in circles and lacks substance! 😒 Trump already won in my opinion. 🤨
1299,"Harris: Please, don’t come… don’t come…<br>Trump: Oh, I’m gonna come!!!"
1300,Time for her to get the knee pads out 😂
1301,You guys are on crack to think Harris is your savior.
1302,"I agree thar Trump does not have  the same knowledge to work his way to the presidency loke Kamala did,  nobody wants to jump in bed with Trump.  He  is already married and happily so.  Doesn’t have to sleep his way into office again.  Kamala is going to go to work again starting now.  Who’s first ?😊which way is the path to the presidency.  <br>JoeB"
1303,Harris should have been working their ticket like gangbusters prior to Joe&#39;s debate anyway. She better get busy and stop smokin.
1304,She was silent all these years to me. Do you think she can win against Trump?
1305,😂😂😂 <br>GO T R U M P   2024 🇺🇸🫡🙌🏻
1306,I&#39;m voting for anyone but Trump
1307,"Some don’t Trump, nobody likes Harris…"
1308,Y&#39;all are screwed
1309,Harris is the best choice!
1310,"Had Trump chose Tulsi as his VP, Kamala would be automatically out."
1311,😂
1312,Kamala can’t win because she’s unpopular.
1313,"The only hope that the Republican party now have if they want to win this election is to call upon their god and savior/aka Donald Trump to recall, remove, and replace JD Vance."
1314,Will not get my vote
1315,This entire situation make me laugh it’s so ridiculous
1316,Ok. 😂😂😂
1317,Democrats need to prepare for 2028 election. This election is already lost.
1318,"Yah, kamala is really popular among the kids"
1319,"If Trump said God saved him,maybe God chose a candidate who doesn`t say his name for nothing.AMEN."
1320,I am now voting again!! Harris gets my vote !!
1321,🤣🤣🤣 As soon as I saw the headline !
1322,well trump now certainly won that women is a clown
1323,Cackling Kamala 🤣🤣
1324,"Until recently, I had known idea she was &quot;African American.&quot; I&#39;m wondering what percentage of her genes that is, like 25o/o? Playing the race card is ugly  whether it comes from the Right Wing or the Left Wing."
1325,Kamala Harris👍👍👍✊️✊️✊️
1326,WSJ trying to be funny with that question! As much as I love my sister Kamala she would be a complete disaster! It&#39;s a man&#39;s job first of all not a womans! Nothing against women they have work that only they can do! It&#39;s to bad some women dont appreciate that. I&#39;ll pray for all! Much LOVE to everyone! ❤❤❤
1327,"With new Democrats candidate settled, they are now busy working on the “Kamala Curve”!"
1328,Automatic loss for Quamala
1329,It’s pretty funny tho how Trump is going against a second woman and will most likely win again.
1330,if kamala can stop laughing in public...and stop talking in public...and stop appearing in public then she might have a fighting chance against DJT
1331,She will never be president 😂
1332,Why is a felon no banned from any US election
1333,Oh lord she ain’t any better than he is.
1334,To simply answer the question of the title: nope
1335,It sad she fup her job as vice president
1336,As if
1337,Best news in a long time!
1338,where was she all this time? I guess it was a good strategy to keep her energy for this moment

1344,It’s amazing what people believe at face value and don’t look any deeper into the lies they say.  Bidens drop of statement was strongest economy ever.  Which even democrats know is not true.  Everything cost more and people are dying at a faster rate than under trump
1345,Remember the second amendment...
1346,How can a candidate win based on insults and lies instead of a clear plan of government?
1347,"Breaking news: Looking for another candidate for non valid president?....USA haven&#39;t had a valid  President in 107years now, why?... because the real American citizens by federal law never had voted for the president, so this is not important..."
1348,Still Trump and Vance in November!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1349,"It´s about character. Well, the lack of character of the one candidate is obvious."
1350,She has no chance. They should be putting kennedy up.  He would win.
1351,America is so focused on her being black that they forget that she’s also Indian her mother is freaking from India. Therefore Kamala is part Indian. I’m pretty sure that people from India will be supporting her. namaste
1352,"WSJ, you had this video ready before Biden announced?? just few minutes since he announced you created this ?? how???<br>You knew this before?? or You caused all this??"

1358,She doesn’t know what she talks about
1359,This is a stranger candidate against President Trump???<br>This has got to be a joke....
1360,"Well, Harris is both a bit younger and much more sane than Trump, so....."
1361,"Respectfully,<br>Harris is clueless and without an antidote on any front and center issue presented to her especially with global foreign affairs that require strength and leadership<br>No one! Both men and women are not free from the CONSEQUENCES of mismanaging what they do with their immature and adult spirit heart mind and body with false expectations having others pay for their broken behavior and indecisiveness to not be one hundred percent responsible or taking full ownership for their actions with what they do with their half-baked thinking desires feelings and emotional use of their bodies. Self-discipline and self-control are underused human gifts that when cognized and used properly lead to discernment and unshakable character personality and maturity that contribute to societal growth and development without human hindrance and restraint. She too will be mentored behind the Obama&#39;s including others like them Harris is just not authentically genuine to say the least. It&#39;s the same as jumping into deep deep waters not knowing how to swim kind of like how her commissioned one job as VP was to manage the boarder"

1392,Mexico just elected a Woman President 😊
1393,kH cant even put a sentence together ...... is she going to be the nominee???? Its scary
1394,And the best vice president alongside Kamala Harris is Joseph E. Stiglitz. He is a Nobel prize winning economist who makes pivotal economic argument for the left wing and he already supports Medicare for All because he understands that it would save us 5.1 trillion dollars over a span of ten years (Peri 2018).

She  can draw support from many sectors. I hope that she doesn&#39;t adopt a meme of &quot;I am a leader of the free world.&quot; It should be something different, such as &quot;I am one of the leaders of a diverse and free world.&quot;"
1412,"Who wants to go back to an Obama like presidency? Nah don’t vote emotionally, vote with your intellect."
1413,No way can she win. She has no support among African American demographic. Many thinks she’s playing the minority card in order to garner support among minorities. She’s largely seen as weak and unlikable to the average working American. Easy win for the republican voters. IMHO I’m just observing!
1414,"Obama was a shrewd politician, Harris is good at sleeping with people to get ahead"
1415,So all she has is her identity? sad that is all we have thought about.
1416,Actually it’s a great chess move to take Trumpety Trumps out of the msm endless coverage. 🎉
1417,only bobby kennedy can beat trump....but the democrats hate kennedy cuz hes anti-corruption and not woke. they would rather see trump win than support bobby kennedy. smdh
1418,Hope Netanyahu will follow suite as he is suffering from mental health too
1419,FIRST FEMALE US PRESIDENT ..  lets get it !!!
1420,"Trump is to old &amp; not healthy either, I am glad Biden dropped out. We need young blood period ."
1421,"Great title for this video😂😂😂😂😂. EVERYONE knew that forcing biden out would make her President, and NOBODY (with an actual brain) wanted that,otherwise it would&#39;ve already happened."
1422,"Everybody is gonna know in a short time,who GOD IS."
1423,As a black Cuban woman I’m voting based on content of their character and policy! NOT FOR WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE!
1424,"Kamala just can’t match the eloquence, enthusiasm, charisma, and energy of Barack on the campaign trail I’m sorry to say. She certainly presents herself as an energetic individual, but she simply doesn’t resonate well"
1425,Does anyone have the guts to challenge her for the nomination?
1426,"Dividing and categorizing people into these categories is insane. Black is one group, women are another. And only because she is black and a woman, those categories should vote for her? The color of their skin and gender is why Harris deserves to be poltically appointed? Modern world racism."
1427,Are you NUTS ?
1428,"WSJ first attacked Biden. Now, they are doing &#39;character assassination&#39; of Harris."
1429,Dalia Rose Hibiscus is in her Word Cave as we speak jumbling up Kamala&#39;s speeches in order that she may lead the country into &quot;idea voyages&quot;. lol What a joke!
1430,How about Jared Moskowitz for Democratic nomination? He&#39;s 43 and has shown to be very quick witted in the House. <br>I&#39;d vote for him in a heartbeat.
1431,polls are bs remember hillary was leading polls??
1432,"She will lose to Trump.  Run a clean slate with no Hunter or Gaza stench on them.  Pick someone around 50 yrs old and for a complete ninja move, run Kinzinger as VP.  THAT will beat Trump/Vance.  Oh, btw JD, &quot;Hang JD Vance!&quot; is not far off from &quot;Hang Mike Pence!&quot;  Trump will turn on you, too."
1433,They&#39;re gonna lose because they turned against Biden
1434,"wait...so theyre thinking...Biden is gone, now Mamala should beat Trump??!!!! Cmon nowwww!!"
1435,Kamala Harris lamo Kamala Harris? the dems can&#39;t be serious with that pick
1436,Reason = life (love: understanding/reasoning = wisdom from the heart I.e. unconditional/holy love/spirit is the life of the subconscious/father truth/son)<br><br>Trump is the worst terrorist magic act; the Van Gogh of fraudes by the thieving heart of conscience living; the father of lies
1437,That&#39;s just false....KH doesn&#39;t stand a chance
1438,"I don&#39;t care.I have KING JESUS, BRING IT ON.PEOPLE."
1439,What is she known for ? She hasn&#39;t made a name for herself.
1440,"She&#39;s locked up more black people for petty Marijuana charges than any Prosecutor in California history. She withheld evidence that would have gotten a man off DEATH ROW, to use him as slave labor for wild land firefighting. The democrats were just making sure Tusli wasn&#39;t the VP pick for Trump before they picked her lol. Look up Kamala vs Tulsi debate highlights. The left is lost."
1441,As a young Hispanic I am 100% voting for Trump!
1442,"If elected, I&#39;d like to see Kamala Harris surround herself with younger people around her age in her cabinet and top positions."
1443,Democrats are getting a late start and they can field much stronger and more experienced candidates than VP Harris.
1444,so the only good thing the news has to say about kamala is that she&#39;s a non-white woman wow this is so embarrassing
1445,She&#39;s not
1446,One big advantage she has over Trump is that she isn&#39;t a psychopath.
1447,This will cause the Trump camp to do what it has never done well: adjust.<br><br>Harris has had 3+ years of intense media training she never had before her campaign. Plus she is absolutr prosecutorial magic off script.<br><br>Game on!
1448,😂😂😂
1449,"Kamala will get crushed by Trump - Kamala is the border chief and over 10 million illegals have crossed in the Biden presidency, killing hundreds of thousands of Americans from crime and drugs - this administration is a disgrace and Kamala as the boss of the border has been an unmitigated embarrassing disaster."
1450,Keep a mic in her face <br>She will destroy her own chances with her non-sensical babble.
1451,Prosecutor Harris
1452,Don’t fall for it America
1453,She slept her way to the top - ask Willie Brown
1454,You&#39;ve got to be kidding me 😂
1455,"Do you hear how the democrats talk about the black vote? Like it&#39;s some sort of treat to be taken claimed and demanded to do a particular thing with... the democrats Use the black vote once every 4 years and pander to them,  Then turn around and literally do absolutely nothing for them.<br>Kamala Harris laughed and joked about keeping people in prison on silly drug charges way longer than she should have, have fun with that candidate."
1456,WSJ…. This is ridiculous
1457,It doesnt matter what kinds of voters she can attract. Can she do the job better than Trump did?
1458,"We did not want Harris as president before and did not even want her as vice president.  Val Demmings should have been selected.  Again, we did not want Harris then, and nothing has changed.  No to Harris."
1459,Harris is useless. Hows the boarder doing tho?
1460,If Kamala be the nominee I will turn my allegiance the greens to the black immediately (that’s a HOTD refererence)🥥
1461,"President Trump again having competition with a female candidate, how will this election race will look like? Will it be like Hillary&#39;s race or will be beaten Trump in this turn of competition on third time.  Trump has one win, one loss, we will and wait this😮😮😮😮😮😮"
1462,"I don&#39;t even vote, but I know Trump has already won."
1463,"No,No No and I’m a Native American Woman !!! Please ! Don’t!"
1464,"she gives off bad substitute teacher vibe that is gonna take over for 2 weeks, in an already wild class."
1465,Поздравляю!<br>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1466,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=398"">6:38</a> Jerkin&#39; Tudix"
1467,"1st Black FEMALE President!!! Republicans should be VERY VERY SCARED <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23presidentharris"">#presidentharris</a> cannot wait"
1468,I love how they immediately go straight into DEI topics.
1469,1856 election the Democratic  replacement was James Buchanan and he won. Franklin Pierce was the incumbent and he dropped out of the race. I won’t be sorry to not hear about Biden’s age non stop.
1470,Trump 2024!
1471,A debate between The Greatest President in our Lifretime (DONALD TRUMP) and a cackling hyena would be fun to watch!
1472,"Kamala will be a great President. Get to know her and her values before you decide she “just ain’t it.” A great women’s role model, a great poc role model, a great ally for all things minority and majority. Her dual heritage background matters only because she’s a great example of what the U.S. of America were idealized on and how cultural convergence usually leads to earthly revelations and revolutions within frigid sociopolitical structures. Informed and compassionate. Always willing to speak to the subject. Qualities of a leader."
1473,"The only thing she has over Biden is her age. She&#39;s yet another DEI hire to continue the puppet show. If she were to win, the country is completely screwed. She&#39;s not a good politician. She&#39;s a DEI hire."
1474,NOW TRUMP HAS TO GO AGAINST THE 2 THINGS &quot;HE FEARS MOST! A &quot;WOMAN WITH POWER&quot; AND A &quot;BLACK WOMAN WITH POWER!&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1475,Kamala Harris would be a disaster.  Get someone from a Midwest swing state.
1476,Her voice is like nails on a chalkboard
1477,"now every republican is obliged to vote for Kamal, now Trump is the old guy!"
1478,First time I’ve heard her name since 2020..
1479,A this was big relief
1480,"He WAS the President, wasn&#39;t he? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=33"">0:33</a>"
1481,Kamala beats Trump in policy and facts.Keep going Kamala.
1482,I quote SpongeBob SquarePants…”Good luck with that.”
1483,Strong debater?? Tulsi gabbert  wiped the floor with her and so will trump or JD
1484,Kamala is NOT African American!! She is biracial Indian and Jamaican...
1485,Kamala hehehehehehe😂😂😂😂
1486,"Uh ,,No way ,,she is a joke"
1487,Trump has already won.  Biden leaving the race is just the cherry on top
1488,Yahoo! Kamala the dragon will be the next president of USA.
1489,Kam will win on the basis of a woman&#39;s right to choose and will go on to be the 2nd best President that the country has ever had.
1490,"People, she’s ruining America 🇺🇸 she did absolutely nothing for the people!!!!"
1491,"She needs a vice-president like Gavin Newson, a young and beautiful guy. It will take have of the votes from Trump."
1492,Just look at the border....
1493,Now convict Trump is the candidate with questionable faculties.
1494,Who cares if she the first black anything? Voting for Harris would be the same as voting for Nicolás Maduro. You can expect the same results.
1495,"The fact that Dems can&#39;t unite in pushing Michelle Obama to run is enough for a lot of liberals to give up hope this election. GOP pulled a shitshow so divisive someone like Harris won&#39;t work. Liberals should realize and accept that at this point, it has become pure theatrics. Michelle Obama won&#39;t just put up a fight, it will crush Trump. But it&#39;s sad that it looks like they will opt for the weaker option. Wake up Dems!!! You need to level up your spectacle."
1496,TRUMP 2024
1497,She’s not African American lol
1498,Kamala DEI(Didn’t Earn It) Harris! With how systemically racist/sexist she claims this country is it will be a huge contradiction to THEIR OWN NARRATIVE if she wins!!!
1499,How is she even better than Hilary who trump destroyed?
1500,"Let&#39;s be honest, she&#39;s not qualified . Never was in any position she slept her way into."
1501,too late
1502,C&#39;mon you gonna let Trump win again by beating woman jeeez 😬
1503,"First woman, first black, first asian, lawyer and prosecutor, ideal to run against a convicted felon who wants to be a dictator, and the dirty spineless politicians that support him."
1504,"She did not do a good job on immigration, so I don&#39;t think she can run a country."
1505,KAMALA WILL PREVAIL
1506,"Billionares on kamala,  they will let u know if &quot;ur democracy&quot; vote was at least half right, not looking good tho, 😂 😂 &quot;my democracy&quot; &quot;our democracy&quot; 😂 told u , nobody knows what that means, just words for suckers"
1507,Harris/Buttigieg 2024!!
1508,It&#39;ll be a landslide for trump
1509,We can&#39;t vote for a leader based solely on their personality  the policies matters a lot
1510,Good step
1511,Kamala 2024!!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Let’s go!!!!  History in the making!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
1512,Kamala Harris is attached to Biden and needs to step aside as well.<br><br><br>BRING BACK BERNIE SANDERS!!!<br><br>The debates will be LEGENDARY
1513,Kamala loves tubesteak!!!😂
1514,I don’t think she is the good choice
1515,"Kamala=Biden , <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#Trump2024</a>"
1516,"Assuming she becomes the Democratic Presidential candidate, which is by no means a sure thing, I&#39;d say she&#39;s marginally better than Biden vs. Trump.<br><br>She checks boxes, and a lot of voters make their choice on that. There are those who would consider themselves  enlightened for voting for a woman of color, and Kamala doesn&#39;t have anywhere near as long a baggage train as Hilary.<br><br>On the other hand, she&#39;s never faced the kind of high-stakes election as 2024 for POTUS, and has never faced as determined an opponent as Donald Trump. She was elevated into the Senate by the Willie Brown machine, and did practically zip when she ran for the Presidential nomination in early 2020.<br><br>Even Biden&#39;s people were embarrassed by her public appearance bumbling, and kept her under wraps as much as possible."
1517,"I don’t think so, Kamala to  me was a ghost VP, she did nothing and is very unpopular, they can put her in but the dems will loose."
1518,If you listen to her more than five minutes you will dislike her . She is completly fake and throws the race and gender card too frequently .<br>You can’t deny that she supported all the  radical BLM rioters and she supports whatever the wind blows . Hate Trump or Biden but both believed in something .<br>I will hold my noise and vote for Trump
1519,WSJ &gt; What a Pack of LIARS
1520,The primary is wide open
1521,"I&#39;m MX.n + US Citizen)  USA is not two persons dependable. The Trump frontier&#39;s fence is a HIGH expense USELESS proyect.   January 6,  what He,  Mr. Trump was doing?  meanwile a bunch of vandals hitting The Capitol.HIDE President.<br> Joe Biden   Please Common Sense."
1522,lol she&#39;s never fkn winnin
1523,"Not taking sides: America wasn’t ready for woman president back in 2016 when Hilary Clinton was running, nor is American ready now in 2024 with woman president (specially of color) to be a president. This increases chances of Trump winning. Just a thought."
1524,She really isn&#39;t much of an upgrade over Trump.
1525,WSJ has lost all credibility that&#39;s why I did not re-subscribe!
1526,"No, no, no !!! Please 🙏 people? Don’t fall for this !!! She’s a failure!!!!"
1527,What can you do for America? You were charged to handle the border crisis.  Have u done that? You ignored America and our safety.
1528,&#39;how Harris communicates&#39; <br>Absolutely her strength!!<br>😂🤣😁😅
1529,"She&#39;s like a nervous, cackling hyena."
1530,Americas most exciting reality tv show
1531,She may be worse than joe in all honesty 😂
1532,Korean Americans for TRUMP 2024!!!
1533,Now who’s HARRIS VP Nominee! 😅
1534,God saves America.If Kamla Harris become president of the Country.
1535,Kamala Harris: “Joe... hold my beer” “I got this”
1536,"She is stronger, no doubt. She is not like Hillary"
1537,Kennedy 24!✨🇺🇸✨🇺🇸✨🇺🇸✨
1538,No more corn pop!
1539,Kamala for the win. Let’s go 🙌🏼🙌🏼🎉🎉🎉🎉
1540,Couldn&#39;t Obama technically run as Vice President? Lol I think that might spell trouble for Trump. A Kamala/Obama ticket.
1541,Hopefully the women voters don’t ruin this country like they have everything else since the beginning of time
1542,Biden opposed busing and was accused by Harris as being racist by closing with &quot;...and that little girl was me.&quot;   The truth is that Kamala was attending private school in Chicago and never contended with busing.  Harris is a liar.  Her accomplishments in Democratic party include nothing of worth of value.  Her failures while Vice President will be used against her and her pandering to hyphenated Americans will expose her as the real racist/sexist in the upcoming election.  Democracy is not on the ballot; common sense is.
1543,Yeaaah! Now we only have to fight the master of the puppet. <br>Kamala.
1544,Nop .
1545,Too little too late
1546,A Kamala Harris/ Michelle Obama ticket is probably the only thing that could compete with Mr. “Teflon Don” Trump right about now.
1547,No hate Crime bill for Blacks No Reperations No vote for her remember what she said that she would not do anything just for Blacks!!!
1548,People who put her down has been listening to propaganda. if they really researched her accoplishments and the many agencies she created in her state they would know she is amazing.
1549,"Trump ❤️🇺🇸 even if you don’t like him, he’s the best and safest man for the job"
1550,Republicans taking away bodily rights from women is gonna backfire real bad 💙 Harris 2024
1551,What a Joke !
1552,SUCH A HIPOCRITE KAMALA WHAT A JOKE
1553,Harris lock up young black and Hispanic and Arab Sen Bernie Sanders had more young people everywhere
1554,"She appears Indo-European, not African!"
1555,Kamala is strong but Bernie is the best public servant and can run circles around politicians on both sides.
1556,Kamala 2024!!
1557,GAME OVER for The Democrats !
1558,"Harris reminds me of Eve in the Garden of Eden when she took over the decision making - and the rest is history. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA""></a>"
1559,OMG. No.
1560,kamala Harris lol...
1561,All Harris needs is a solid VP with minimal baggage (aka not the leader of Cali) that is a strong speaker and I think they have decent odds.
1562,These debates aboutta be crazy😂
1563,Literally joever
1564,😂
1565,I guess God came to biden and convinced him to drop 😂
1566,"Once again, I read the comments of the desperate trumpeteers trying to minimize a woman, more so because she&#39;s not white. Kamala Harris will be your next president."
1567,Democrats are voting Republican <br><br>It&#39;s over for Dems
1568,go Donald Trump you have to win for the sake of AMERICA 🇺🇸!
1569,Look at how she messed up California…
1570,What can be unberden ...... you know what i mean
1571,"Nobody wants that ticket, but yeah do it, do it."
1572,She has been bad for the Black community. We don’t claim her
1573,"Kamala is not Obama, he is charismatic, she is annoying."
1574,LOL. She’s incompetent
1575,Harris for 2024!
1576,"If she gets elected, knee pad sales will go through the roof"
1577,I literally forgot Kamala Harris even existed. I think that says something about how much she has done for this country
1578,"Democrats just handed the presidency back to Donald Trump.<br>Also, the comparison between Obama and Kamala is a reach."
1579,KAMALA HARRIS PRESIDENT IF DEMOCRATS WIN. NOT LIKELY THOUGH.
1580,"Kamala? Might as well through away the campaign, Biden on Lester Holt said she wouldn’t make a good president. Not even her boss believes in her."
1581,"A woman to make decisions about her own body, but I can’t make decisions about what my children do. The government wants to do that for me."
1582,She will pick Hillary or Michelle.  She will run against  Nikki  H.  First time 2 women running for the top job in American history.
1583,This lady as president LoL she will laugh at all our problems. Useless.
1584,"Trump has been one step forward. I am sure Trump had a strategy for this, cuz we know this could be happening, imagine Trump!"
1585,Come to Oakland CA and ask how much good she did as the mayor 😂
1586,Vote for Kamala. We need a Brahmin Hindu woman as President.
1587,"Unless she dodge bullet time,there is no way she could win , too late."
1588,Kamala for the loose. Joe didn&#39;t loose.<br>You&#39;re going to get sick of hearing that.😊😂😊
1589,What a joke
1590,Trump&#39;s 2nd term is assured.
1591,"WSJ, you KNEW this was going to happen."
1592,Let&#39;s raise a Big Mac to our future felon president!
1593,No one in Cali like her because of her record as how she called herself Top Cop
1594,she is weak
1595,The Dems just insured that DT will win.  Shame on them!  🤬
1596,It&#39;s over 😂
1597,"Who said it, &quot;Every time I light my lighter, my lighter gets lighter, until my lighter doesn&#39;t light anymore.&quot;"
1598,Obama as Vice President!
1599,If K. Harris runs it&#39;s an automatic loss for the Dems... IMO as a full blooded African American woman.
1600,It will be scary if Harris becomes president. Most  will vote for her just because it is women. That is sad.
1601,HARRIS 2024 !!!!!!
1602,HAHHAHAHAHA Kamala is the most hated candidate. Dont even try to compare her.
1603,"This is so upsetting. The democrats fell for this divide and conquer. The gathering of many poll information is as old as both candidates it’s means nothing…. The red wave turned blue!!!  And please don’t think you can out debate Trump it doesn’t matter. I bet he will decline to debate the new candidate just as he did with the republicans party.<br>Wow…what a world we live in when a handful of people control the majority, so disappointed."
1604,Stronger in what way?
1605,"Shes not African American. Harris is of Indian descent, yes there is a minority population of Indians living in Jamaica. Indians have the HIGHEST average income of any race in America. She couldn&#39;t be more privileged."
1606,We will lose without Joe Biden
1607,"To be honest, I don’t like the fake smile she puts on whenever she’s not expressing another emotion. When speaking or doing something specific she can look serious, but whenever she’s just walking around, she has the gigantic grin that is out of proportion to the situation. It’s a small thing, but to me, makes her seem disingenuous."
1608,Trump will beat Harris by a landslide
1609,maga is losing its mind! Trump has no chance against her.
1610,Birdbrain Harris.
1611,No more 50 to 49... 49 to 50 votes. Get real.
1612,There is no chance the dems will win this election so they might aswell let Harris run this time and have a real candidate next time.
1613,"Will we see Bush vs. Gore again. <br>The GOP will contest Harris being on the ballot in the swing states. Then send it to The Supreme Court who will again come through for Trump.<br>We&#39;re F<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cked"">#cked</a>!!!"
1614,Harris/Sanders 2024
1615,"I’m no racist at all, but a female &amp; black US president?  Harris has no chance, that’s just reality…"
1616,"Wat Does Color Have To Do Wit Anything 🤦🏾‍♂️ We Are Doomed In Trouble , God Bless 🇺🇸"
1617,The Rock 2024! Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot;  Johnson 2024!
1618,Yall had this in the vault WAITING!
1619,Harris is so much easier.
1620,She talks through her nose.
1621,President Biden is a functional incompetent.Kamala Harris is an unconscious incompetent!
1622,Get your Venn diagrams out!
1623,Bahaha no
1624,Kamala Harris said that Donald Trump doesn&#39;t have the character to be the President of the United States....Then how did Donald Trump win the election in 2016?
1625,"I think  for women,  abortion  is populsr  and Camilla  is a good choice"
1626,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1627,Taylor will be endorsing her any day now. That&#39;s three million young voters. Hunter and any side deal he may have made are now irrelevant. That&#39;s going to be hard for the average mage voter to let go of. The house dog and pony show is dead.
1628,Kamala has 0 chance
1629,Harris was Biden&#39;s DEI hire to fool minorities to keep voting D.  Fool you once?
1630,Im glad we were all just surprised as WSJ about this news. They sure were fast to put this together lol.
1631,She will slay trump in a debate
1632,comparing kamala to obama is wild wishful thinking. She is more like Hillary and we know how that worked out in the past.
1633,She&#39;s not.
1634,Unburdened by rationality and common sense.
1635,They&#39;re comparing Obama to Harris? HOW?! That is an insult to Obama.
1636,Lol no 😂
1637,No. She’s not the best candidate. Truth.
1638,Do you think that a woman can win the presidential election?  I am dubious!!
1639,The GOP now owns the old-guy problem
1640,So now we need new ballots?
1641,"to level the playing field, Kamala has changed his pronouns to he/him"
1642,"Female power at the top! It&#39;s past time. Hillary should have won but now it can be corrected by voting Kamala Harris,✔️"
1643,Kamala Harris is worse than Biden as debilitated as Biden was! Kamala Harris just does not have the substance to be president!
1644,Finally the Democrat&#39;s will Boast an all female ticket: Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg
1645,Can Kamala pick Michelle Obama as her VP pick?
1646,"Kamala Harris gets my vote!  I&#39;m voting for women&#39;s rights for their bodies, women&#39;s voting rights and women&#39;s equal rights!  Ladies, VOTE BLUE!!!!!"
1647,Trump has no plan for the nation . he just spews hate and that is what his base want to hear
1648,Well I guess Trump is the next president!
1649,"Biden and Jim Clyburn put us in this situation. Remember 2020 Clyburn cut the deal to back Biden if he would take Harris as his running mate. Remember right after Clyburn backed Biden to get him elected in 2020 he announced he was taking a &quot;female&quot; running mate. Of course announcing he was going to take a female running mate and not who would be the &quot;best choice&quot; to pass the torch too, (which the VP always becomes) so now we stuck in this sh*thole. We all need to scream at the top of our lungs for Democrats to nominate GAVIN NEWSOM. He has the Obama quick wit and is so well spoken like Obama, and has the Obama good looks too, which is what modern politics really want! Even Gretchen Whitmer or Hakeem Jeffries would be a far better choice then Harris. We need to quit playing the race card and basically &quot;hinting&quot; you must be a racist if you don&#39;t back Harris. Harris has never been popular or loved like an Obama or many others, it may not be fair but it&#39;s just the way it is. In a race, when it comes down to saving democracy and defeating Trump, as the late, great, Vince Lombardi once said: &quot;Winning isn&#39;t everything; it&#39;s the only thing.&quot; It&#39;s not what color the candidates skin is or if they are a man or woman, it&#39;s who is the best candidate to be win. If Democrats are so great then why do we keep losing so much? Can&#39;t you all see that?"
1650,She’s not stronger
1651,Look at her record and its suicide to put Harris on the ticket. They are thinking we are too stupid to see through to not look it up. A liar a traditional politician 😂
1652,This is GREAT NEWS!! Like I knew we were gonna win against Biden but I had no idea it would get this much easier.
1653,She will be an easier victory than Biden was going to be. She pulls even worse than Biden did. I hope they do put Harris in. That’s the play they need to make.
1654,"Harris is a wonderful opponent for Trump. She is a woman, she is person of colour, and according to this video that’s about it."
1655,Wow this is stupid
1656,Can&#39;t  watch this. Please be truthful.. no lies
1657,Harris has my vote already! Go BLUE 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
1658,Good thing there was a question mark after that statement !<br>You&#39;ve got to be kidding !<br>That THING against a legend ?
1659,"Think of all the women who will vote for VP Kamala Harris. All women who want freedom of body, financial, emotional, spiritually etc. Go Kamala Go! 🗳️✔️"
1660,And where is Kamala personality? 😅😂
1661,"Every argument you had for Kamala also goes for michelle obama, but i feel like there is a more high view of michelle than kamala. The left isnt even wild about kamala and michelle has a stronger hold on the left."
1662,Does anybody actually like her?
1663,Trump 2024!<br><br>They not like us..
1664,PHILIPPINES FOR TRUMP
1665,Harris/Cheney??? I know Cheney would have to flip but Tulsi Gabbard did.
1666,Da of San Francisco<br>District attorney of ca <br>Vice president <br>All flukes I guess?
1667,"Well, this intro didn&#39;t age well."
1668,Blacks only represent 12 % of the vote so who cares ?
1669,Kamala Harris Is equally corrupt Liar than Trump. No way does she win impossible.  RFK jr.😂
1670,PHILIPPINES FOR TRUMP
1671,Already know where this is going lol she gonna spit out a whole bunch of bull to get those votes and this country going right back to square 1.
1672,KAMALA...THE ANSWER IS...BLOWING IN THE WIND...UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN...WTDDDMFU
1673,Bring the popcorn its gonna be like 2016 again 😂
1674,V.P. Andy Breshers from Kentucky!  Sorry if I spelled his name incorrectly.  Gov Andy is loved.
1675,"I much prefer a DA over a country lawyer. Go ladies, shine, and win. Win big! The DA is inherently conservative, (good for everyone) and she has a record of following the law. What is the point of having laws if everyone breaks them? A poor man would likely go to jail for hiring a prostitute. Sad more people don&#39;t admonish Trump out of the race. He is literally a pos. Misplaced priorities."
1676,🇺🇸Pete Buttigieg for President 🇺🇸
1677,Nope she will not be the first lady president I haven&#39;t seen her at all since the democrats took office she&#39;s a plant from the far left
1678,She couldn&#39;t even get 1% support in the primaries. This should be fun to watch.
1679,Harris is a horrible candidate.
1680,The fact that abortion is the number 1 issue we have is a sick joke. We are a nation of delinquency. No wonder other countries don’t like us lol
1681,Where in the Bible it says that the new Babylon will receive a lady leader and become desolate
1682,"So now it is on A Female prosecutor that specialized in prosecuting child sexual assault cases in the Alameda County District Attorney&#39;s Office is now running for president against an admitted rapist and a regular at pedophile island run by Jeffrey Epstein.  With his business operations set up in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Epstein bought an adjacent 72-acre island called Little St. James for just shy of $8 million in 1998. It is known that this is where he operated his sex trafficking activities and where most of his pedophilic acts occurred. Some of the youngest girls who were trafficked onto the island were said to be 12 years old. Donald was there over 10 times...  Soon this will be public knowledge.  Jeffrey Epstein was an American money manager and registered sex offender and BFF&#39;s with Donald Trump. In August 2019, he died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial on charges of sex-trafficking minors."
1683,No one in their right mind can possibly think Kamala Harris will win. She has not been impressive AT ALL!
1684,We have no other choice for democracy than Harris 🎉
1685,if kamala stops talking down to pople she has  a shot
1686,Can’t stop 🛑 ha ha ha USA 🇺🇸 with first Indian 🌍 ruling with ha ha ha language up
1687,"We need energy, shetalks like she is telling a story. People like energy"
1688,She dropped out of the primary very early with almost zero percent of the support!
1689,Well this was well timed
1690,"didn&#39;t know <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=426"">7:06</a> trump already named Harris a laughing Kamala😂😂"
1691,Remember folks when you are huffing so much Copium you become a WSJ reporter
1692,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=173"">2:53</a> she only shares the superficial traits. she doesn’t have any of the same intangible qualities that Obama has"
1693,"Sorry, but Kamila Harris or Clinton are not it"
1694,"Funny how the WSJ mentions how she soared quickly in the primary, but chose not to cover that she crashed down even faster to only 1-2% just a few weeks after that and had to drop out. Also, funny that they only mention her background as a prosecutor to say that it makes her a good debater (dubious claim), and not mention that her record as a prosecutor was so offensive to the Democratic base, that her support plummeted as soon as people were made aware of it (thanks Tulsi!). This is called a puff piece, folks."
1695,Obama  his not nice  he should  endorsed  Harris
1696,Harris is much worse than Biden lol
1697,"Its scary to see that the only thing that democrats care about is race politics. Like yeah, its important, but lets more than that. There are so many problems that exist that arent just social. We need real results on real problems."
1698,The GOP should seriously think about replacing Trump.  He&#39;s been showing signs of senility with his increased rambling off message and looks to be in generally poor health.
1699,I would love Kamala to get the job
1700,Can&#39;t rely on polls. People often change their mind. GOD BLESS AMERICA! AND GOD BLESS THE 2025 POTUS AND OF THE FREE WORLD!!!❤❤❤
1701,Since the Civil War they are 0.00 Wealth Status 2024 USA 🇺🇸.  Did that ha ha  ha USA 🇺🇸
1702,No
1703,We don&#39;t need Camalalalalalal
1704,Q
1705,Lets see if America elects a woman for the first time.
1706,She won ZERO delegates in her 2020 run and as VP her signature job was the Border... &#39;nuff said.
1707,"I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if somehow K.H miraculously is elected, fraud, lies and sketchy politicians ..the distrust is real"
1708,"We vote BLUE no matter what- This election isn&#39;t about one person as president its about voting for Democracy, Freedom, We The People."
1709,"I don&#39;t care. President Biden&#39;s sacrifice has just hardened my resolve to vote against trump, doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s on the ticket at this point."
1710,"Kamala is Lisa Simpson, If you know you know."
1711,what Harris been doing? Nada...even Michelle Obama has better chance
1712,"Not sure who’s the stronger candidate but I can imagine what will be, unburdened by what was"
1713,"So WSJ is so on top, they don&#39;t think Obama can come in as a Vice Prez. But can he ?<br>In fact, the relevant constitutional provisions, their histories, and their purposes all point to the same conclusion: A twice-before-elected President may become Vice-President either through appointment or through election and — like any other Vice-President — may thereafter succeed from that office to the Presidency ...<br>Please WSJ, upgrade ur staff."
1714,At least she can walk.
1715,"If people can vote for that slapper, then the country has got seriously big problems."
1716,"Oh great ,this should be easy the united of America against the DEI coalitions. Don&#39;t forget that Kamala Harris, before and Biden were elected told the Black community and the rest of the country what her and the Dems had planned to give the American citizenship nothing !!! And they did just that they screwed the American public for illegals...The producers of this news clip don&#39;t have a clue..."
1717,The only way she beats Trump is if it is totally Rigged of which l bet it will be.😡
1718,Trump .....forever🎉🎉
1719,Define looking forward to this!!
1720,&#39;Vote me for me because I&#39;m black&#39;
1721,"Ya&#39;ll should talk about what she&#39;s done for law enforcement in California...<br>very ethical records, right?"
1722,You Saw Old Mindset USA 🇺🇸 now atheist N got fooled by 🌍 and got their$$$ reward Zero ha ha
1723,Kamala is unelectable. Dems lol
1724,No
1725,Hahahahahaha
1726,No chances for Harris. I&#39;m sorry.
1727,"Y’all can elect who you want, I’m still gonna be voting for RFK"
1728,She&#39;s been in hiding since Biden was elected.  How would she b a better candidate 🤔
1729,I bet Trump ducks any debates with Kamala Harris.  Still wonder what his nickname for her is going to be.  Time for the MAGA mill to crank out a new narrative.
1730,"People of color is a racist divisive term. It just means anyone not white, like white people are a seperate species from every other ethnicity on the planet. The Left keeps pushing this whites vs everyone else narrative."
1731,"I think Pamela Harris is a very strong candidate.  She will be facing ferocious attack from Trump and Vance who only has the ability to demonize Democrats and the country. I hope she will show her ability as a strong leader which often perceived by voters as one who is knowledgeable of the issues Americans are facing, be able to articulate democrats policies convincingly.  In addition with her prosecutor’s experience, i hope when she faces attacks from the Republic and in particular Trump and Vance, she should in her campaign continue to expose Trump’s failure in his presidency, his ongoing pathological lies, his disregard for law and order , his despise of women, his fraud, his dishonesty, his character and moral etc etc."
1732,Kamal? She couldn&#39;t beat Biden in 2020. She barely came in last prior to the DNC convention then.
1733,She got ZERO votes in the primary &amp; dropped out first!!!! You expect voters to just forget she repeatedly lied about Joe&#39;s decline? You think the fear mongering &amp; gaslighting will still work? Was the way Joe was pushed out after 14+ million people voted for him in any way democracy? Will the people choose or the elites? I&#39;m done
1734,Cackling Kamala Harris is not trusteorthy
1735,Yeah he&#39;s definitely a democratic political strategist.
1736,"Harris, “ I am thankful for this opportunity. It is an opportunity I am thankful for, it is an opportunity I should be thankful for, I will continue to be thankful for this opportunity. Thank you Mr president for this opportunity."
1737,Ah! The Border Czar !!! Willie Brown or Montell Jordan for VP!!!
1738,"Mrs.  Harris has very low ratings as vice-president through the length of her tenure of that position. She has been incompetent. Now, these folks here want her only to attract blacks and women votes regardless. Just to stay on power. 😊 She has been part of the most corrupt and incompetent administration in modern US history. Why continue four more years of the Biden/Harris disaster?"
1739,I eagerly wait for the debate
1740,Kamala Harris 2024!!!
1741,"Oh, Republican gaslighting is strong in the comments I see."
1742,The first two soy boys I had to go
1743,"Where are these polls being taken and who are they surveying? Their Base! Democrats are losing their base in droves, as being are tired of the lip service and of always receiving the shaft by the Democratic Party.  And if you keep on lying about the things Trump has said and is saying on the issues; then the more constituents are going to turn their backs on the party, when they decide to fact check what is being said."
1744,lol. Please be the nominee.
1745,RFK jr tells America the truth 👏
1746,Let&#39;s go Kamala Harris. The next president of the USA
1747,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=97"">1:37</a>  Kamala harris is African-American? WSJ get your facts right"
1748,"As a prosecutor in California, she put more minorities in jail than any other prosecutor in history.  Are you kidding me?  Good luck!"
1749,K Harris is a joke. I literally never see her.
1750,Nope. She is word salad.
1751,Nothing to lose
1752,She NEVER GOT A SINGLE DELEGATE!!! DROPPED OUT BECAUSE SHE NEVER GOT OVER ZERO PERCENT ( 0%) !!! ZERO!!!
1753,YOU HAVE TAKEN HIGHER GROUND BY LEAVING THE OFFICE .. THANK U FOR THE SERVICE TO THE NATION ... NOW LET SOME ONE WITH SOME GOOD YEARS N WILL TAKE UP THE JOB .. DEFEAT THE PROJECT 2025 .. SAVE DEMOCRACY
1754,"If KH is running, there will be a landslide victory for DJT"
1755,Hillary could run again instead of Harris
1756,Then whyd she do so poorly in the primary....
1757,"Ok dems, they did it to ya again. Let&#39;s substitute old guy with dementia for the giggling goofball. We can scaremonger voters to another horrible 4 years serving the donors with the orange boogieman again. You have a great choice ready to bring sanity, diplomacy and prosperity back to the country. Vote Kennedy or get Trump, we all know that&#39;s the choice, fortunately it&#39;s a great choice to have for once. Kennedy 2024!!"
1758,"Kamala doesn&#39;t stand a chance of beating Trump, Pete Buttigieg however has a better chance, imho."
1759,Is anybody else getting blocked from playing the video just asking?
1760,We all knew this would happen
1761,the felon will never debate Kamala.  lol
1762,"we going to hear her cackle  for 4 yesrs when she laughs Oh God <a href=""http://no.lol/"">No.lol</a>!!! Trump please win so  we dont among other things hsve to hear her laugh lol"
1763,Trump 2024
1764,"Wasn’t Kamala the Border Zsar ? I’m not sure what that means but she , Mayorkas and anyone else involved with the border has failed miserably, I’d say purposefully."
1765,"Since trump lived , do you think 🤔 Biden is stepping down now.. put trump in a bullseye 🎯  is what Biden said.. this looks like a setup"
1766,Tulsa Gabbard cleaned Harris&#39;s clock in a debate.
1767,These ppl are drinking the Delulu Juice!!!
1768,IM BLACK WOMAH VOTE ME IN YULL IM JUS LIKE U
1769,Kamala just needs to reiterate the Biden accomplishments..... pause.....
1770,Go woke go broke. She is a DEI pick....<br><br>Ridiculous
1771,Ho wow she will beat the corrupt Trump. Kamala will win the big race. She have it all the way.
1772,Never win she’s lost 😡
1773,😂😂😂 not really.
1774,Nope !!! Trump2024!
1775,Kamela has 0 chance.
1776,What happened to Bill Beck better? Kidding.
1777,"She&#39;s got the Mola Ram vote as well as the Ghetto vote, tough to beat."
1778,Trump will win now !
1779,"Harris will be laughing like a Hyena all the way to the unemployment line.<br><br>I eonder who wrote that letter for Biden, he can&#39;t even finish a sentence...<br><br>Well I can&#39;t see him getting a charge for any of that money laundering he&#39;s been doing, over 50 billion later maybe even more you&#39;re probably buy Epstein Island and live happily ever after."
1780,TRUMP 2024
1781,Do yall forget how Kamala swept with Joe in the debates in 2020? Joe won by pure Trump hatred and Obama legacy. Kamala was VP herself and she is obviously is a better choice then Trump I feel so much better about the election now
1782,"Biden can defend his decision by saying that he is currently able to serve as a president and can campaign for the Nov. election however he is not sure of his health 2, 3, 4 years into his second term"
1783,"The passage of time says she is not a suitable candidate for anything let alone president. Incompetent affirmative action candidate will be exposed big time and this will be a massive embarrassment for the Democrats, just wait..."
1784,Viva  kamala
1785,"Trump is liar , TRUMP is never tell the truths, make story fakes not qualify for presidency is TRUMP ."
1786,2025 plan should sum it up !!! VOTE BLUE all the way !!!
1787,I&#39;m a Democrat and I ain&#39;t voting for this woman
1788,how many women and black people did she put in prison in california
1789,I wonder how much mint chocolate chip ice cream they had to give him to finally step down. 🍦 🍦 🍦
1790,FJB!
1791,WSJ probably had a video ready to drop about Trumps assassination incriminating Iraq. Oops.
1792,"It doesn&#39;t matter who they send, they&#39;re gonna lose."
1793,"Bring back De Trump. We have seen the vids. The remorse. Let’s just do what needs done. Yall w Biden and the dark party going for global war, conquer and divide? Cool.. siike"
1794,No way Kamala Harris is a stronger opposition to trump than Biden was. Harris is a joke. Just concede and focus on the next election. It would be trumps final term.
1795,Kamala Harris has been the worst vice president in modern history. Can&#39;t support Harris.
1796,"The first catholic president was done in with a bullet, this one was done in by multi-billionaire media empires. Boycott WSJ, Fox, and all the Murdoch enterprises."
1797,Pivoting attacks from Sleepy Joe to Word Salad Kamala won&#39;t be a problem for Trump.
1798,kamala harris is not black. she is barely light skin.
1799,"Oh, so it&#39;s Okamala now..  So nothing changed."
1800,"no, shes just as bad......"
1801,Yea they are right some
1802,I don&#39;t care I&#39;m still voting for Trump
1803,MAGA
1804,Lol the candidate that got 1% of the dem vote despite being the states preferred candidate.<br>No she doesnt have a chance jn a real election againdt Trump.<br><br>But they will probably build her up and then pick someone else last minute.
1805,Kamala been president for 4 years due to Biden health and being old 😅😂now Harris want to be a president for a real tittle because has of now Kamala is the president not really joe
1806,Remember how they lied about Biden’s condition! Keep that same mindset when they speak on the woman that didn’t win 1 Dem delegate in the 2020 primary. Not even Democrats wanted Get! Look up how she treated black inmates in California.
1807,The RUSSIAN Trump TROLLS  are infesting. this comment section.
1808,"Democrat&#39;s minimum for presidential candidate in the Whitehouse: tanned skin, and being a &quot;pregnant&quot; person. Not based on any actual sound policies or actual merits."
1809,I love VP Harris’ word salad.. looking forward to it being exposed even more so.
1810,"What everyone seems to be glancing over here, is the importance of the passage of time. The passage of time is the passage of time and the passage of time is the passage of time that the passage of time has the passage of time to the passage of time is the passage of time and the passage of time that the passage of time was the passage of time is the passage of time is the passage of time is the passage of time..."
1811,Well I guess now we can all see first hand just what can be unburdened… by… what… has…been.
1812,"No votes for TRUMP 2025 . NO NUMBER FOR TRUMP . DICTATORSHIP, COMMUNISM COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP. NO TRUMP .!!"
1813,It will be supposedly following :Harris will be president and Biden will be her VP. It was the same thing with Baruch Obama as president. Enough of Biden and his clique and it doesn&#39;t matter if he will be minister or Vice president or only hidden under table there
1814,Bruh tulsi gabbard literally destroyed kamala harris.
1815,Hey WSJ stronger how stronger tell you what tell me what this unqualified VP is stronger when she did nothing whatsoever to help this country but damage it tell you what I&#39;m getting tired because I&#39;m a white male having myself judged because I do not vote for people of color I vote on what&#39;s best and who&#39;s qualified to run this country and to be honest Kamala is not qualified period so keep playing that card because its tiring  in conclusion Trump MAGA for me
1816,"If she came across as such a great debater in 2020, how come she was one of the first to drop out due to her horrendous debate performance?"
1817,Kamala sucks how could we forget how much she despises the poor and homeless?
1818,"She&#39;s not an African American woman, she identifies as Indian, she said it on public TV, what are these people smoking?"
1819,"Trump vs Harris!?? <br><br>A debate!?<br> <br>That man cooked little Marco, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton, Joe. At this point just give it to trump🥱 sorry democrats just sit this one out…"
1820,"No way, and it has nothing to do with color at all.  I will not vote for a cackling crow and I know I&#39;m not alone in that opinion.  Harris does not have what it takes IMO."
1821,Tulsi Gabbard tourched her campaign
1822,"if Trump doesn&#39;t win, America will e doomed hence the entire world. vote wisely this is not about individual or party, but about who has our best interest"
1823,GOD BLESS YOU PRESIDENT BIDEN! YOU DID THE BEST EVER RUNNING OUR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.. GOD SPEED AHEAD.
1824,All you Trump fans sound nervous.😂 too funny!
1825,Show me a poll pitting Taylor Swift against Trump.
1826,"HAHAHAHAHA.<br><br>Sorry but there isn&#39;t a single voter who&#39;s going to vote for Kamala, unless you&#39;re deeply entrenched in left wing propaganda."
1827,Lol
1828,"Replacing Biden with Harris wouldn&#39;t gain my vote, since she&#39;s part of the Biden administration I&#39;m dissatisfied with. I&#39;d gladly vote for almost anyone new just to vote against Trump, but not anyone from this outgoing administration."
1829,Do nothing Harris can&#39;t even manage her first assignment from her boss  managing the border problem.  That&#39;s because it&#39;s been wide open.
1830,"KAMALA HARRIS. VOTES FOR KAMALA HARRIS, VOTES NUMBER FOR KAMALA HARRIS. FOR FREEDOM. FOR DEMOCRATS COUNTRY ."
1831,Her poll numbers are worse then Joe 😂 wrap it up it’s done
1832,&quot;expert&quot;! 😂😂
1833,"I’ve never been a fan of Kamala - but that fierce, grating, prosecutorial vibe is just what could destroy Trump.  And the relief we all feel at having Biden out (as much as I love him) could well being in a tsunami of support.  <br><br>Harris all the way."
1834,Worse than Biden!
1835,"Harris may perform slightly better in the fake poll but she has to have a clear plan for America and defend her failure as a VP, starting with her lackluster role as Border Czar"
1836,she is not articulate in interviews . I can&#39;t believe she was a prosecutor
1837,bring on another presidential debate
1838,They are wrong to assume Kamala’s popularity among Blacks.
1839,Kamala Harris Win. ♥🇺🇸💋
1840,She can be like Lyndon Johnson after Kennedy - Carry through BIden policies but bring a different focus
1841,"she won&#39;t be able to win, terrible day when Biden withdrew. ppl in Europe, start learning Russian"
1842,to be fair Kamala has been president for 3 years already
1843,Only if Harris picks Andrew Yang as VP will I cast a vote for her
1844,A woman cannot win Trump. It is simple. Stop all these nonsense
1845,Kamala Harris speaks in Voodoo Riddles! She is totally UNQUALIFIED to be President. She&#39;s been a horrible VP!
1846,"Kackle, kackle, venn diagram, electric bus, kackle, kackle, legs up, do not come, do not come.<br><br><br>Trump: I&#39;m gonna come."
1847,Vote Harris and VP Buttigieg
1848,"Trump landslide incoming, its not even funny anymore"
1849,Go Kamala go!!!
1850,They stitched the video together in record time.
1851,HarrisXWhitmer
1852,"Yes nobody the system than you, no wonder you do not pay taxes. This election became a comic race😢"
1853,I can’t stand Kamala’s voice
1854,"Condi Rice for President as an Independent .Maybe,R.F.L.Jr .could win with  Harris.The dream team would be  Condi Rice/Clinton"
1855,"She doesn&#39;t even come close to Obama in charisma or ability to articulate, the only reason you making comparisons is because of their race which is actually kinda racist."
1856,Dems rug pulled democracy on the dems that preach how important it is.
1857,Sad part is is I don&#39;t like Trump but the Democratic policies are making a working-class person like me who&#39;s worked my entire life just trying to provide for my kids and my family the hardest thing to do on this planet so unfortunately unless I see something drastic change I can&#39;t for anybody Democratic as of right now because they&#39;re trying to kill my lower middle class status and drown me with everything going on because for some reason they keep wanting to get people who don&#39;t want to work at all money the people like me or trying to just work away from my kids 5 days a week because I&#39;m a truck driver trying to do what I can to provide for my kids the hardest thing in the world to do and I dislike Trump but how can I not vote for a Republican and Democratic policies are what&#39;s ruining our country right now FYI I&#39;m a self-aware sarcastic extrovert loud fat idiot so nothing you can say to me is going to hurt my feelings cuz I know who I am and I don&#39;t care
1858,"She 💯has my VOTE!  💙<br> Also i dont do polls 😉 <br>So, in my opinion...polls don&#39;t mean much. <br>We show up when it truly matters. 😎✌🏾"
1859,❤❤❤😂😂😂
1860,She is a stronger candidate? Give me a break!
1861,Don&#39;t sleep on her especially with woman&#39;s rights on the front line and the feminist movement
1862,TRUMP HISTORY BLUE WAVE COMING 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
1863,"Now this is funny, Harris………..I mean , I can’t stop laughing…."
1864,😂
1865,😜👎😁
1866,Trump is still going to win
1867,Not only is Joe Biden the worst President in history.  He is now a quitter too.  And now Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for President.  I can&#39;t wait to hear her annoying laugh when she is asked a tough question 🤣.
1868,Who is the old fart now?
1869,"At 26 seconds, oh, please! Such BS! I&#39;m out of here. 🙄"
1870,O M G !  OOOOMMMMGGG!!!!  It&#39;s  AMERICA???!!! NOOOO!!! IT&#39;S THE  ZOOOOOOOO!!!!
1871,"It is disgusting to have a professor saying &quot;we need to do this&quot; &quot;we need to do that&quot; when talking about the Democrats... you need to be unbiased when representing yourself to your students.  You aren&#39;t a professor, you&#39;re an activist, and you should be ashamed of yourself."
1872,Just the title of this video made me laugh out loud! 🤣😂<br><br>I laughed out loud because I was loud when I was laughing because I was laughing out loud and people could hear me laughing!  That’s why I said I was loud when I was laughing! 😂
1873,Who is the old fart now?
1874,Nope she is even more hated than joe biden. They will have cemented their loss in with her or gavin. Best to have gone with someone new.
1875,BIDEN MEDICAL CONDITION<br>TRUMP MENTAL HEALTH<br>ANYBODY NEW HANDS DOWN WINNING!!!
1876,"I’m scared s**t of a Kamala Harris White House,like the feeling I had when I was 7 watching the amityville horror"
1877,Trump will still win
1878,Expect the media to start ramping up the support for KH.
1879,"Votes for HARRISS , VOTES NUMBER FOR HARRIS ✊✊🇺🇸🇺🇸"
1880,Who wouldn’t be?
1881,So her whole thing on the border was addressing the root causes of why people are flooding into our country so her deduction from this experiment was to go to a couple countries and Central America and realize the economy is not so great there and we need to fix their economies. Well when 200 countries are sending people are we supposed to fix the economies of 200 countries instead of just securing our border with the policies that Trump had that were working. That&#39;s one thing I hate about these politicians and I could say it on both sides is when they get in if the previous guy had good policies that are working just keep them in place but they tend to just rip out the policies of the last guy now I know Trump pulled out some stuff that was awful like TPP was going to be terrible for America I&#39;m glad he pulled out of that The Paris accords that tied our hands and made it so we couldn&#39;t be economically viable tied to this cult of climate change was terrible and he pulled us out of that The Iran deal was awful he pulled us out of that So those things were logical they were just bad policies that Obama did. But to completely open the border and get rid of all trumps effective border control policies show that they don&#39;t care about American citizens and they don&#39;t care about law and order in this country. People are supposed to come here in a very specific way even asylum seekers Trump had them remain in Mexico while they applied Biden just lets them in and then they have to wait for a court date in 20 years from now to see if they get kicked out of the country which none of them will ever show up to. It&#39;s a farce This woman did a terrible job on the border and her administration did it terrible job on everything she has blood on her hands
1882,VALHALA KAMALA!!
1883,She is not even African American woman. She is Indian / Caribbean. Why she been called African American.
1884,Kamala is laffin’
1885,She put black people in jail for weed. Why would anyone vote for her?
1886,"Dems have a death wish if they appoint Kamala. As a Black man Middle age man, I will no way no How vote for her. <br>Now if Michelle run, no question she has my vote but if Kamala, I’ll vote Trump and be a first time Republican voter"
1887,She ain’t Obama

1893,So the dems are even more hellbent on trump being president.
1894,It&#39;s even better. Trump triumphant 2024! ♥️♥️♥️
1895,"I don&#39;t think she is as loved by women, as she is disliked by men.  Whatever the Women of &quot;The View&quot; think, I don&#39;t think she wont make Republican women change sides, but a lot of moderate Democrat men may do."
1896,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=184"">3:04</a> young?! 🤣shes gonna be 60 by November"
1897,There&#39;s no way she can beat him.
1898,What about her investigating the root causes re border crisis?
1899,Kamala is not a person to run America.
1900,National unity ticket:<br>KAMALA / KINZINGER<br>🇺🇸  🇺🇸  🇺🇸  🇺🇸  🇺🇸  🇺🇸<br><br>Kamala will vigorously prosecute the case against the insurrectionist.  Now who&#39;s old and incompetent?
1901,Dems ain’t got no chance 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. What do they have to offer? Kamala?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 or wait Newsome or Michael Obama🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣.<br>Kamala will be thrown out by Dem party 🤣😂😂. Delegates there don’t like here neither 🤣😂😂😂
1902,"Hispanic voter here, I was considering Biden, no way will I or any hispanics that I know vote for Harris.  Trump 2024 I guess... wow... what a huge mistake by Democrats."
1903,Politics aside. Its pretty impressive how fast these videos get put together
1904,Worse than biden
1905,If Biden wasn&#39;t that old he would have been fine. Kamala has no chance
1906,Cackling kamala has zero qualifications and credibility 🤦‍♂️
1907,"Now, Harris&#39; handlers must mind the optics for her as in a more powerful image. That image is not brushing hair from your face. No world leader does that!"
1908,You think the opinions of Beta males matter? Dream on.
1909,"The difference between puppet Joe and billionaire Trump: one was discarded like used piece of toilet paper, the other conducted his next public rally immediately after surviving an assassination attempt."
1910,Delusional
1911,There has never been a replaced candidate whose replacement won.  Never happened.
1912,"This is why they waited until after the primary was done, so they don&#39;t have to prop her up with actual facts and a history of being a good candidate. She&#39;s just the only one whose name people recognize and isn&#39;t Trump."
1913,"COONMALA HARRIS REMINDS ME OF DR SEUSS  CHARACTER THE GRINCH WHO STOLE  XMAS,  THERE IS A REASON WHY TRUMP WAS A FIRST TERM PRESIDENT &amp; SHOULD REMAIN THAT WAY, TRUMP NOR BIDEN ARE FIT TO BE PRESIDENT PERIOD, &amp; THAT INCLUDES COONMALA AS WELL"
1914,"This is a set-up, Harris do not qualify to do what has to be done for this falling country. This, as they put it, part African lady is not burdened by the past, and how can she not when the past is ever before my people. Note: what was being done to the African here in America during the past is still happening, how can not be burdened. My people please be mindful, she will be good for them, but as for your youth she has no motherly compassion. She would be a setup for a trump win. The ticket for such a time as this is, Michelle Obama and Elizabeth Chaney.<br><br>The Debriefer"
1915,Americans will NOT vote for a woman president especially kamala harris
1916,Harris is the worst choice for America
1917,"Yeah lets not address the lie that Biden has been telling democrats and the American people this whole time.  That he was running, that he wasn&#39;t going anywhere.. that he was in it to win it.   All BS and always has been."
1918,"Her word salad is so cringe, I&#39;d rather listen to Biden."
1919,A country is more than ABORTIONS!
1920,This comment section is a brainrot. And so the racism begins...
1921,Harris makes a better president for Haiti and Obama for Cuba
1922,"Harris should campaign on &quot;two Trumps in every jail cell!&quot; Tippy canoe, endorse Harris."
1923,Biden may be the best but he may not go for 4 years.  He will be working behind the scenes helping Harris and the VP pick.
1924,Sorry but to answer your question! NOPE
1925,"Bro WSJ does this all the time, how many videos do you have of stuff that never happend?"

1929,She&#39;s not African American. She&#39;s India-Bahamian
1930,I hear a lot of gibberish
1931,This is the biggest attempt to spin one of the  worst possible candidates....and newsome will be added to the ticket.
1932,"In my India, democracy is dead, and Modi has become a dictator. Speaking out against his government results in being labeled a terrorist, having our homes demolished, or disappearing without a trace. Voting him out is impossible because he rigs the election results."
1933,Kamala is a good choice
1934,"a country that isnt homogeneous will always be divided by race, tensions, and economic problems, europe for europeans."
1935,This election is over .TRUMP 2024

1944,Vote BLUE 💙🔵🟦🔷🔹
1945,THIS VIDEO SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOUR SECONDS LONG........<br>&quot;NOPE&quot;
1946,Reading through the comments I ran across the idea that this was produced instantaneously. I bet this production is many weeks old
1947,Right 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1948,"She will have the teleprompter now . The regime continues, remember that ."
1949,Trump &quot;nobody knows the system better than me&quot; just like he said &quot;nobody knows taxes better than me&quot;.  Just a lot of BS all is life and his mantra.
1950,TRUMP ❤
1951,Abortion is nothing compared to Homelessness and joblessness and corona virus and China taking over or banks and car companies in America
1952,"This is gonna be interesting. Now, imagine how Trump will be roasting Kamala during debates, lol"
1953,This is going to be the easiest win in a presidential election ever.
1954,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1955,Blowbama don’t want to give up that 4th term. He has a lot of selling out America to do yet.
1956,"FJB DOWN,  BLACK CHINESE HARRIS UP😂😂😂 AND DEEP STATE DON&#39;T WANT PRESIDENT TRUMP SO THSTS MEAN  ELECTION WILL NOT HAPPEN 100% BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS TRUMP WILL WIN BUT DEEP STATE WILL START 2ND CIVIL WR SO ELECTION WILL NOT HAPPEN,  GET READY FOLKS."
1957,The only way she could win is if they absolutely cheat once again and we need to keep track of this We need cameras at every polling location people with their phones recording everything and not allowing us to see what&#39;s going on We need to be there for the count and watching it We have every right to be there and we cannot allow our country to be stolen again by these clowns
1958,I want to know why people say she is Black when she is not.
1959,Everyone here is not listening Biden is pulling out of race because of his mental capacity. If he don’t have the mental capacity to run he definitely should not run country. Let Harris have these 4 months before trump becomes president in November
1960,I can imagine by what can be and be unburdened by what has been
1961,Funny she thinks she&#39;s qualified 😅
1962,😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅

1966,&quot;Choose your fighter. Trump. Harris. Outstanding.&quot;
1967,One policy not on the list is gay marriage. If they went after women first it’s just a matter of time that they overturn gay marriage laws.
1968,"It would be cool to have a woman President one day when someone qualified ran, but in 3 years AS VICE PRESIDENT she&#39;s STILL done nothing but cover for Biden and embarrass us, she&#39;s accomplished nothing, at all... and her entire career has been focused only on elevating her profile.  She only cares about the position, not the responsibility.  She is actually a security threat, because THIS is the kind of person who&#39;d sell out our country to special interests like nobody else."
1969,Power to the People’s 🗽
1970,I dont think she is . She is worse and she does not make it. But that is okay we need a strong leader no more mental folks
1971,"Roots, she doesn&#39;t know what that is."
1972,Kamala Harris in 2024!! She&#39;s strong and intelligent and it&#39;s about time for a woman to take the reins. Thank you America and thank you President Biden!
1973,Skamala for president is only a DISASTER  waiting to happen.

1975,Dear God she doesn’t make sense!
1976,Project 2025 Michelle Obama just watch
1977,"You are dreaming, Harris will never be  elected..."
1978,I am not going to say anything about Biden. There&#39;s nothing good to say but CYA!
1979,"So now we see the DNC and party leaders have forced Joe out, despite all of those voting for him. I guess voters and votes really don’t matter. This might actually be the real threat to democracy. Bernie says Hi."
1980,Yes! The Moon is made up of cheese! 😂😂😂
1981,The trolls are out for sure. These comments all saying the same thing from the ai algorithm

1984,"Shee won&#39;t be able to beat Trump. Too much baggage, especially for her time as Californias AG."
1985,Yes
1986,"Whether it&#39;s Biden or Kamala, Obama will be the kingmaker.  Time will prove it. I bet."
1987,"YOU WANT MICHELLE OBAMA, NOT HARRIS."
1988,AFRICAN AMERICA LADY IM EXCITED SHE WILL REPRESENT MY ROOTS YOU GO KAMALA
1989,As of today I don&#39;t see any polls saying Kamala would beat Trump.  If she loose they are putting this all on her.
1990,Imagine voting for Joe only for Harris to be nominated 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1991,Young? She’s 59!!!
1992,I’ve seen it all now!

1998,ITS JOVER!!!!!!!!!
1999,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2000,how is this legal if all the states voted already in a primary?
2001,"Why don’t dems talk about real issues like ss, inflation, border crisis, wars over seas…please stop talking about Trump and focus on policies!"
2002,A more competitive election? Her approval rating was and still is worse than Biden&#39;s!
2003,"In all smart and strong Americans, they chose this lady😂"
2004,"The media cannot help themselves; always reading into what is missing, now on Pelosi views on Harris! Can she (Monica) read minds? Why not wait until Pelosi gives her endorsement! Thanks Rachel and Katy for being a little patient; esp as mainstream media does not show reticence!"
2005,Harris 2024
2006,Let’s fight for democracy and never be deceived by communism
2007,They would rather put the realm on torch than see a WOMAN ascend the Oval Throne...and an Indian...yea right
2008,Sha isn&#39;t even african. 😂
2009,Trump is a grifter... what do grifters do? ... brag! They make themselves look bigger than life itself... but have no substance
2010,She gonna lose HAAARDDDD haha thanks Joe 🤘🇺🇸
2011,"I&#39;m not a Trumper, but never seen someone as unqualified to be president as Kamala. Where has she been the last 4 years other than screwing up the border royally??"
2012,"😂❤😅 It&#39;s highly doubtful that Kamala Harris will ever get the chance, but only the &quot;PASSAGE OF TIME in the PASSAGE OF TIME, by the PASSAGE OF TIME&quot; will prove me right! 😂❤😅"
2013,"Sorry, maybe Harris is attractive for African-Americans but it&#39;s highly doubtful she appeals to any other minority demographics.  She surely doesn&#39;t appeal to Asians after building her career on her &quot;African-American&quot; identity, an identity that is problematic, in my view, because both of her parents are foreign-born and she has zero ties to legacy African-Americans who are the descendants of slaves.  She also might have some appeal with single women but again, I question her appeal to women who are married with children since Harris has never had any children and inherited two adult children in her marriage to Douglas Emhoff."
2014,"what a joke, I dont think ive seen anyone on earth more cringe then Kamala."
2015,She can&#39;t win she is a joke
2016,"Americans have to face reality , this is not about a Candidate , it&#39;s about a Party... ONE for Democracy= Democrats  ONE for Autocracy= Republicans.. it is what it is and use you Common Sense if you want a keep your freedom."
2017,she will up the black vote but white voters won&#39;t touch the cackler.
2018,Harris sux
2019,"Biden stepping down wasn&#39;t done to let Harris lose, i&#39;m sure."
2020,<b>&quot;Kamala Harris: A Stronger Candidate Against Trump?&quot;</b><br><br>Are you serious?! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2021,"I wish Kamala Harris has a stronger, more forceful voice to drown out Trump&#39;s bullying remarks that he&#39;ll undoubted throw at her. Nevertheless, I&#39;ll vote BLUE."
2022,"With her S laugh, come on!!"
2023,Trump will beat her especially if there is a debate
2024,❤️🤍💙
2025,WSJ was waiting for Biden to drop out😂
2026,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=325"">5:25</a> why does that man always look lost<br>Im for Kamala, most people group her and biden together so<br>we can keep that easy Trump Win coming"
2027,wsj  inhaled the whole tank of copium
2028,"Same message, just a different messenger."
2029,How can someone with lower approval ratings then Biden be considered to have a better chance than Biden.
2030,Not according to their polls. She will be replaced at the Democratic convention.
2031,I dont see any foreign leader respecting her if she wins 😂
2032,Dems ain’t got no chance 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. What do they have to offer? Kamala?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 or wait Newsome or Michael Obama🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣
2033,Please protect our democracy
2034,If the Democrats going to build their campaign base on abortion they are in trouble..
2035,No Harris.  Let&#39;s bring back our Constitutional Republic back.
2036,"she wont even be the first black female president, biden took that from her"
2037,Another gift to trump
2038,TRUMP JUST WON CONFIRMED 😂
2039,Nunca podras una mujer .en usa yo no votare
2040,If Kamala Harris runs trump will win by a 90% lead lol
2041,Kamala is a joke 😂
2042,Anybody with common sense will not vote for harris.
2043,Strong debator?
2044,This country is in trouble. The worst possible candidate.
2045,only if they steal it again.
2046,"The president is a president of the people.  As we know the president is a president FOR the people.  And to be a president FOR the people, you must be a president OF the people.   And we know the people pick the president.  -Kamala Harris probably"
2047,"Black voters are tired of the Demoncrats holding them down!<br><br>Yeah like someone who can&#39;t even do the job that she was assigned you noticed that she&#39;s done nothing for the border, she flat-out refused her first order from Biden."
2048,The WSJ has been such a joke
2049,Biden should have stayed in. He had the best odds and was chosen by primary voters. It is not a good look for the DNC to go against the primary outcome.
2050,How many people are going to be fooled again voting for K Harris?
2051,"Get the popcorn ready for the convention next month- Should be interesting, lol."
2052,So are he crooks going to give back all of the donation money because legally they do but when did the democrats ever follow the law.
2053,Sorry America. What a mess.
2054,"Kamala Harris was the worst presidential candidate on the ticket for the Democratic party in 2019 The leadership of the Democrat party could have picked much better candidates like Bernie Sanders, Michael Bloomberg, Tulsi Gabbard, etc..  Instead they picked Joe Biden who had significant signs of cognitive decline in 2019. Democrat leadership has let down their party, and the citizens of the United States.<br><br>The Democrat party needs to find new leadership to lead them in a New and direction that will help this country."
2055,HARRIS CAN NOT WIN
2056,Harris has not done anything for our country.all Harris dones is lie.
2057,Sharp as a TACK!!!
2058,Trump will destroy her in the debates.
2059,The Democrats and Harris sucks.  Trump 2024
2060,Y&#39;all have to be out of your minds if you guys think Kamala Harris can lead our country 😂😂
2061,&quot;The democrats loved Obama&quot;<br><br>Then why not bring Michelle Obama into the race and replace Harris? Michelle has all the name recognition in the world and can do literally everything else better.
2062,She is not an “African American Woman”
2063,"Kamala Harris only got 1% when she ran for president,  Harris is not a serious person for the presidency, please, this woman is a nut, she&#39;s done nothing as a vice President, she walks around laughing all the time , when she does talk it&#39;s all jumbled word salad and nobody knows what she&#39;s talking about, come to your senses people, remember a vote this woman is a vote for a lost America."
2064,😬
2065,"No, as impossible as Biden makes it seem, Kamala is somehow worse lol"
2066,No way!
2067,The fake street journal: she&#39;s not even black. She’s half Indian and half Jamaican.
2068,Kamala can&#39;t communicate with politicians from other countries because she&#39;s not &quot;a Chosen One&quot;. She knows what a woman is unlike Ketanji Jackson? Jackson had 2 children birth from her body? Harris had 0 children? These 2 Democrat politicians are DEI hires with no qualifications behind their names.
2069,what a joke
2070,"I mean, Harris will be great at playing the race card, so there&#39;s that. XD"
2071,"The country is going down and down. We need a real American, we need Trump! Trump 2024✊🏻🇺🇸"
2072,Trump Vance 2024！！！Kamala Harris is disaster for US
2073,What did she do during her VP term that will make her stand out against DT? 🤔
2074,Ill vote for Kamala than a felon!
2075,"Kamala Team...Lessen the affirmative head nod she does way too often, during or after making statements (turn the sound off &amp; watch).  <br>Also, work on the nasal voice.  Both are irritating &amp; project weakness."
2076,Harris has 1% chance. 😂😂😂😂
2077,I am a women. During covid with the left administration I was not able to choose what I wanted to do with my own body. I was FORCED to wear a mask! Why does Kamala think that was ok?
2078,AOC would be a great vice president (or Bernie but I guess he wouldn&#39;t want to)!
2079,"How can abortion, and not the economy, be the number 1 priority for women?"
2080,She will lose…
2081,Proof that WSJ is run by an AI which scans the whole internet in real time.
2082,Trump it is 👀  by default. Republican here
2083,"Only thing Kamala did in her career is expand and exploit the prison industrial complex. But I would not worry, her main game is baseless word salads while continuing Biden&#39;s handler&#39;s policies, in other words she&#39;d be toast against Trump."
2084,What about if the US doesn’t wanna female President in general👁️
2085,Thank You Joe!!!
2086,"I wonder how they had this video ready the minute Biden made the announcement, its almost as if the media already knew 🤔"
2087,"My main concern is the economy. The cost of living needs to decrease. The cost of living and crime has increased under Biden/Harris. Conditions were better under Trump. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=55"">0:55</a> The democratic candidates always have the advantage of people of color. And some may disagree with me, but shouldn’t males also have a say in abortion? After all, a sperm is required to fertilize an egg. A woman doesn’t make a baby on her own."
2088,The only people and the only reason anyones voting Dem this election is purely TDS. That party is a shitshow extravaganza
2089,Bs from wsj
2090,She&#39;s terrible
2091,Remember she put a man on death row even though she knew he was innocent.
2092,"Hey Kamala, how did your Border Project go?"
2093,I think every country better quarantine themselves... brave yourselves
2094,Oh boy the giggler will run for the deocrats!
2095,Mouth below feed upper Mouth...
2096,Trump2024🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲 from Michigan
2097,No cost for ads against Harris: just show her trying to speak.
2098,IS KAMALA NOW SUDDENLY SMART ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT
2099,I would love to see Harris/Buttieg!
2100,This makes me think they’re already planning to cheat and get her in because I don’t think she’s that popular of a candidate.
2101,biden made the wrong choice. democrats will lose. guaranteeeee!
2102,"Her job from joe was to take care of the boarder ! We “ ALL” !  Seen were that went - 20 million illegals flowed across our boarders ,and you want her to lead a country , what a joke !  She’s done nothing but assist joes fails in destroying our country !"
2103,She started her political career as Willie Brown’s mistress &amp; was chosen to be VP explicitly because she was a black woman.  She isn’t the strongest candidate the Democratic Party could run against Trump.
2104,Kamal-toe Harris says &quot;Don&#39;t eat the Tide pods&quot; 🙂
2105,That b it  ch doesn&#39;t have a chance in h ell
2106,If Biden resigns now Harris is president let her have that
2107,Kamala Harris jailed countless African Americans for petty marijuana possession. Why would they vote for her?
2108,"Stronger candidate? Yes, she can form words. Strong candidate? Absolutely not, the words formed by Kamala make nonsensical sentences. Everything she touches falls apart."
2109,LOL.
2110,"RFK Jr is their best chance- Remember him? The guy with the life long Dem family, who left the party- He would run as a Dem."

2150,KAMALA = KRAKEN
2151,"Remember Kamala was already running Biden, she WAS president, you vote Kamala you&#39;re asking for 4 more years of BIDEN. 🤢"
2152,Trump has won already. God Bless America.
2153,At least Trump has some intelligence unlike the giggler
2154,"NOPE!<br>She’s unlikable, has done nothing notable. She doesn’t have charisma. She’s uninspiring and unknown. And she’s an easy target to be villainized by the opposition and they’ve already got that negative social infrastructure in place against her.<br>Bernie Sanders would be an easy win.<br>Butgieg would be a graceful loss. He’d be competitive. He’s well-spoken and in a debate it would be a wash. That would be fun and satisfying to see. First gay president. Far better than Harris, Newsome. But ultimately a loss. <br>The DNC needs a big bold move here but they’re incapable of this."
2155,This confirms he shouldn&#39;t be in there right now
2156,What was the point! 😂 Have fun at the party 🎈 📌

2181,So....... She will run on what she has accomplished?  ROFLMFAO
2182,"We should support kamala for women freedom, 💙💙🌊"
2183,"If Hillary couldn&#39;t beat Trump, why would they think Harris could the democratic party will lose out at least in the next 8 years for sure!"
2184,Get tf out of here. Never!!! You think we’re suffering now. Mess around and find out.

2186,Sniffing Joe letters is more like “tales from the grave “⚰️
2187,Trump in 7

2189,Kamala is definitely smarter than Trump but she will have to beat racism
2190,Is the country ready for a woman president? Is the country ready for a BLACK woman president? I hope so. Trump needs to be DEFEATED!!!
2191,"Wow, a three month campaign trail 😅😂😂😂 Let&#39;s kick it off with a debate! 😂😂😂"

2202,"Remember that Biden&#39;s policies will still stand if she&#39;s elected... <br>The person might change, but the party&#39;s values will not"
2203,Looks like the fix is in place
2204,Wow! Pinning black against white now because Democrats want the Obama era back is so racist! You just don’t even know what you say.
2205,She&#39;s gonna get beat way worse Biden remember she was the first to  drop out of 2020 primary Because democrat voters didn&#39;t like her

2231,Since the democrats believe in democracy so much I guess the nominee is going to be RFK right…?
2232,"the female card failed with Hillary, and it&#39;s going to fail again with Kamala, Trump mocked her while playing golf, she&#39;s a terrible choice."

2241,WSJ - propaganda and you are suppose to be the most tamed.
2242,A person of color must not be a factor at any degree to be the POTUS. Period.

2272,&quot;The passage of time is unburdended by what has been&quot;
2273,Let us be unburdened by what has been 😂
2274,Kamala will make a much better VP pick than Trump did.
2275,If Kamala ditch her fake laughter she might might have chance of beating Trump.
2276,All Busses are yellow because they are busses. Thats how you know its a bus. because all busses are yellow.
2277,"Oh my god, is this ONLY because they want to persecute Trump? They dont care about america!!! They only care about what THEY want!"

2279,"Oh great we may get another incompetent, no skills president"
2280,How to talk like KH - pick one word and loop that word several times in the same sentence until the full stop sounds like it could be right. Can you guys not pick a normal human ?
2281,It&#39;s National Ice Cream Day!
2282,HARRIS for president!
2283,So she is the one who is supposed to unburden us by what biden has been

2288,Most useless incompetent vp
2289,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2290,D.E.I. Is a joke! And Kamala Harris has proven that time and time again 🤨
2291,Mr Drumph 🫡
2292,They should pick RFK. He’s the only one close to being a dem that could beat trump.
2293,This proves that Joe Biden at least has better cognitive ability than Donald Trump. I support Nancy Pelosi&#39;s idea of open nomination process.
2294,She would make a horrible president!  She hasn&#39;t even done anything as a vice president! How is she going to be president ??? 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
2295,"She has a great chance, actually. Demographic reasons, and same type advantage over opponent, that Obama had. Say anything contrary, and you&#39;re racist/sexist/anything-ist. They also need to keep her on the ticket, to use much of the funding raised already. If Biden had passed, or would pass in near future, she&#39;s who you&#39;d have, like it or not. If the last two presidents prove anything, the bar isn&#39;t that high."
2296,BLACK MEN  ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP!
2297,My dog would be a better candidate against Trump than Biden. Of course he’s still not a good candidate.
2298,"This is actually strategic by the Dems.  Harris is hated as much as Biden, and they can just get rid of her with this election.  Trump was going to win anyway, might as well get something out of it."
2299,Isn&#39;t Harris in charge of the border? She can&#39;t even handle the border hows she gonna handle the country? Besides she&#39;s also been telling us Joe&#39;s health is just fine... Harris lies.
2300,Stupid is as stupid does...
2301,Don’t worry! There is PLENTY of things for Trump to talk about Harris! Plenty!!!! A plethora! He would mop the floor with the BS she has done and her big mouth would start lying to cover up her BS! Please debate!!!!!
2302,She dont care about reparation act period shes
2303,Kamala Harris really! She’s horrible!
2304,We need Donald Trump than ever. Worse thing than Joe Biden is a President Harris and VP Gavin Newsome couple.
2305,"The trouble now is what happens with the $90 million campaign fund. It&#39;s all pledged to JB and KH specifically. Maybe they could transfer it directly to Harris if she wins the nomination, but even then you can be sure there will be serious legal objections raised over it."
2306,You know what would be funny. Clinton being vp nominee...
2307,Bernie Sanders all the way
2308,How can you vote for someone who never been to the border or Europe?
2309,That&#39;s going to be an easy win for Trump.
2310,Stronger how
2311,&quot;What can be unburdened by what has been&quot;<br>profoundly wicked woman
2312,How can you claim to be for democracy when your presedential canidate is jsut &quot; picked&quot; for you
2313,Harris would be cackling in the face of leaders of other countries !   Who care about abortion when we could face more wars?
2314,We vote for Mr Newsom california ok
2315,Hahahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2316,"Please, America!!!  Come on, Kamala Harris is a joke!  I can&#39;t believe how ridiculous America&#39;s government and judges is now.  It&#39;s a joke!!  The choices we are given prove we don&#39;t matter at all.  I want NONE of them.   🤬"
2317,It shouldn’t be about gender or race. It’s who will bring back the auto jobs who will stop the border crisis democrats have to have someone else
2318,"The comments about her is just wow. She is not popular at all. Wow, they are just handing the presidency to Trump just like that huh, dang."
2319,She is not African American.
2320,"She may be young, but her mind is at a 100 year old"
2321,"The Republicans have to very careful in the attacks against her.A black women. I&#39;m glad She&#39;s going to debate Trump. Now, the chosen the vice president, is critical too."
2322,Trump 2024!
2323,Vice President Harris will outshine and defeat DUMP THE TRUMP!
2324,What a Dink
2325,No
2326,You guys went from Joe Biden is a better candidate to &quot; It does put us in a more significant competitive election as joe biden in the race &quot;
2327,Harris is insufferable. ugh
2328,"Nope spin it again Kamela only had one job southern border, she failed."
2329,At least kamala is more intelect than trump
2330,She accomplished nothing as a VP
2331,Americans has a chance to have first woman president..I wish her very best from Nairobi kenya
2332,You wish
2333,"WSJ, post michelle obama, hillary, newsome scenario videos, please?"

2337,Already starting with the glazing
2338,Hardly
2339,I support Kamala Harris for president. I would have preferred Biden but you can&#39;t always get what you want. Stop listening to Trumps lies about Kamala Harris.
2340,Trump will win for sure now
2341,Kamala literally called young people stupid
2342,VP Obama
2343,Kamala Harris isn&#39;t African American!
2344,This would be hilarious if it wasn’t so pathetic. 😢
2345,We all came from black people who were the 1st on this earth 🌎 theeeee
2346,Not at all !
2347,"this is not going to fall well on her. They just tried to kill a former president soon to be re-elected president. No, one is going to vote for this woman."
2348,Now we find out dem party wanted him out but had no agreed back up plan. Dems keep digging this campaign hole deeper and deeper.
2349,Nope…
2350,You must be a joke. Harris is a mess.
2351,"Ask yourself this question first. What&#39;s Kamala Harris had done for this country within the last four years? Nothing besides support crimes, drugs and illegal immigrants. She&#39;s a joke to be part of the US government."
2352,"Its now The DividedSA,  Thank FJB."
2353,Kamala is not well liked
2354,She is half Indian and half Jamaican. Both her parents were not born and raised up in USA
2355,2020 was rigged in so many ways guess they are working on failed printers mail in ballots for everyone that&#39;s living and dead.
2356,Trump made a terrible VP pick that won&#39;t attract independent voters like me. He needs those voters to win.
2357,Let the racisms on the left begin LOL
2358,"I really don’t know what VP Harris is about besides women issues. We’re on the verge of WW3, how would she handle that along with a thousand other issues? Also, please VP Harris, don’t laugh like an uncomfortable idiot or say your lame “unburdened” mantra. It’s not a ‘thing’ and it’s not a hit with the cool kids."
2359,If democrats nominate Harris. We will not vote for her even though we disapprove Trump. Harris does not deserve the nomination.
2360,RFK Jr. 2024! 🎉 The Only Choice! - Watch his interview with Joe Rogan.
2361,Hill and Kar will have something in common soon
2362,Harris has failed at every job appointed to her as Vice President
2363,She doesn&#39;t have a chance.
2364,If  this is  President Bidens decision  then <br>bring it on. She has my full backing.🩵 🩵
2365,MAMALA MAMALA
2366,"If we forget about race ,gender , etc. and look at qualifications and capability like we do for any other job interview, Harris should trounce Trump !"
2367,Best news ever for Trump.
2368,Harris is worse than Biden lol
2369,Of course not!What a ridiculous question. 🇺🇲
2370,Say it isn’t so. I don’t understand TRUMP and biden were neck and neck in the polls. Why would biden do that? Everyone knows biden could have beaten TRUMP from the basement again. After all biden was there with Covid.  That is what biden did last time. How do you feel about TRUMP AND biden?
2371,Our children will have no future with Harris. Good at laughing. Border on her to.
2372,They couldn’t take out Trump so Biden can win now they have to move into plan B
2373,The biggest mistake in the history of American politics!
2374,I’ll vote for literally whoever’s not Trump

2376,Trump will destroy her
2377,"Cant see this Woman beating <a href=""http://trump.im/"">Trump.Im</a> sorry."
2378,"That is American Democracy where Aipac money plus others do a hollywood type of acting as a form of message to create an imaginary figure to dupe the voters. Once the leader is in power, voters discover belatedly that they voted in a different person altogether"
2379,"Harris ❤🤟<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23blue"">#BLUE</a>"
2380,"Anybody in the democratic party better not run, this time around. It would be a futile exercise, with an embarassing lost."

2385,I hate to break it to you but a lot of people if not the majority thinks she&#39;s stupid. Yeah really screwed up I kind of feel sorry for dem voters
2386,Kamala Harris has flaws like EVERYONE ELSE on this planet but in the end its about defeating Trump and his goons once and for all. As a independent who didnt want either Trump or Biden if Harris runs she will have my vote i am sick and tired of Trump and all his BS.

2393,God Help us.
2394,"&quot;What can be, unburdened by what has been.&quot;"
2395,We heard Biden was vibrant and well fit ….lied to again.
2396,"The next debate should be interesting, an ex-prosecutor versus, well..., you know.<br>Of course I&#39;ll vote for Kamala. Who else would I vote for?... A would-be-dictator, who can&#39;t even bring himself to try to unify the country? <br>On the subject debates, as far as VP&#39;s go, a Buttigieg vs versus Vance debate would also be something to see.<br>Vote for love, or at least as close as you can get."
2397,She is a joke as VP now gets elevated to P to extend the joke B was
2398,What are you all talking about!!! Kamala Harris got destroyed by the other dem candidates when she tried to run! She was terrible!
2399,Do not vote for a convicted felon
2400,this should be on Comedy Central
2401,"She will  run the country  as she did  the border,  wake up America  the media  is already pushing  the race card they  think  blacks must vote for her."
2402,Hiding in Color USA 🇺🇸 got it and know that America
2403,Who said Kamala Harris will in place of Joe Biden? Did they go through any lawful procedure ? It&#39;s a threat of democracy!

2405,Wow ! They had this lock and loaded 😁<br>Gives you Idea about the machinary that actually wields the power.
2406,😂😂😂😂😂😂
2407,I almost think certain elements in the Republican party are thinking about a Harris-Vance contest.
2408,Shall we be UNBURDENED of her Laughs?
2409,Yall had this video in the chamber and I have to Stan!!!
2410,Pelosi didn&#39;t push Biden out just to get Kamala in the White House. This is all part of a plan and the ultimate nominee will be her nephew Gavin Newsom(e?).
2411,Trump: great for America <br>Biden: great for everyone else
2412,"Sickening, just Sickening."
2413,President Kamala Harris. Let that sink in.
2414,No way Harris forget it.
2415,If you vote on personality instead of policy you’re contributing to the downfall of the US.
2416,The orange man will demolish aunt Kamala find someone else
2417,It&#39;s going to be Michael Obama VP
2418,😂😂sure
2419,🤣🤣🤣 good luck 🤣🤣🤣
2420,"so many racist, misogynistic men writing comments...oh yeah, WSJ....."
2421,"So Joe isn’t sharp as a tack? Weird😉 Didn’t Joe just say he was the candidate best suited to beat Trump? Weird. Im starting to think someone has been lying to the people about our president for years now. Wait, didn’t the republicans try to warn us…. But were called cheap fakes….? Huh, i dont think i will vote blue."
2422,"She is going to need all the help she can get, because she will b dealing, with men and or racist people."
2423,Trump said make it up to 15 weeks
2424,Tell us you knew this was coming without telling us you guys knew this was coming.
2425,More than ever women must get the vote out in Roevember!<br>💙🇺🇸HARRIS! 🇺🇸💙
2426,We only care about Bernie.  I&#39;d vote for a sack of potatoes over Trump.
2427,"President Biden is Endorsing Harris, So am I"
2428,KAMALA HARRIS IS GREAT..<br><br><br>AND SHE WILL NEED SOMEONE GOOD..<br><br><br>NANCY PELOSI.. HILLARY CLINTON..<br><br><br>OR MICHELLE OBAMA.. <br><br><br>THEY CAN FIGHT BACK TRUMP..<br><br><br>AND CAN SURELY WIN..
2429,"Is this satire? You&#39;re all off your rockers if you think she could ever beat Trump, or that she would be any good for this country. Dreamland right here. Shameful."
2430,I will never vote based on skin color or gender. Policy is what we should ALL be looking at.
2431,What is she gonna run on boarder security lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2432,Wsj hates Trump. They dont want Trump/Vance&#39;s pro working class policies come into effect. They want pro wall street policies.
2433,This is deranged. She has absolutely no chance. Are there people betting on this?
2434,Huh? &quot;A strong debater in her 2020 presidential campaign&quot;? Is this a joke? She bombed her entire run harder than Haley.
2435,Nooooo sir she watched Joe almost take us out and now she would be the best candidate she is apart of the down fall for USA she should be ashamed of herself but the worst part of it is she is not ashamed PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE consult the LORD JESUS CHRIST on who to vote for put HIM in all that we do we’re at the end let’s put the LORD first she watched everything and did nothing
2436,Joseph Manchin needs to fill Bidens place in the Presidential race.
2437,The Democrats now have a bigger problem on their hands with Kamala. They need to find a way to get rid of her.
2438,"Why is everyone talking about harris? She&#39;s just one of a dozen or two that want to be president. Everyone knows she was a dismal vice president, and she was one of the first to drop out of the primaries in 2020. So what exactly did she bring to the table? And by that, I mean compared to other candidates."
2439,Running mate - chaney or romney - beat that!
2440,She was a vacant vice president how is she going to be a president? There’s more to presidency than abortion? That’s one small thing in comparison to the real world issues.  Omg. Disaster
2441,"yeah maybe when she started, her mental acuity just isn&#39;t there anymore."
2442,Step in Kamala!
2443,"Exactly which policies would change under a Harris presidency?<br>Zero<br>Endless war, open border, skyrocketing, inflation, fentanyl, etc., etc."
2444,Come on Liberal readers where are your LIKES!
2445,Trump 2024!
2446,"Komola harris will loser ,Trump will be next president"
2447,No way America voting a black woman
2448,This country is so screwed. Y&#39;all better repent and follow Yah&#39;s 10 commandments and food laws according to Leviticus 11. Remember the Sabbath Saturday dawn to Sunday dawn. The apostate churches lied to us all. Faith without works is dead. This country deserves a wicked leader. Time is almost up.
2449,"Kamala Harris is not African-American, her mother is from Jamaica, stop advertising false information."
2450,See her at the convention 🎉😊
2451,"The choose is and reveal present said in communicate.but biden motive are say  juesus pray, put  things. Back to free enter the  challenges."
2452,"Kamala won’t be the runner up, I guarantee it"
2453,"If he can&#39;t handle a campaign, then why is he still the president?? He needs to resign."
2454,When Kamala Harris loses she will disappear.  The only time she will have &quot;significant&quot;  influence on our society. She is boring and ineffective.  Willie Brown.
2455,HARRIS TO THE WHITEHOUSE....TRUMP TO PRISON
2456,I don&#39;t think Trump can stand up to Kamala.  She&#39;s smarter then Trump    !.
2457,"If Kamala Harris wins this election (I can&#39;t see that happening, Praise God) America is OVER!!!"
2458,"No matter what she SAYS she will do, doesn&#39;t mean she will actually DO it!!"
2459,I bet they’re gonna get a lot more view in this than they planned
2460,The same banana!  She was appointed as the czar at the border but never visited the area. Another comediian whose favorite stunt is to laugh.
2461,Vote BLUE no matter who!!
2462,Chuckles? Really. They really hate America
2463,n ame her accomplisments border zulu in 3 1/2 tears never set a foot there  charge ai was to dumb to understand it support bernies socclist agenda   when cant answer question guakle laugh
2464,Her biggest failure is the border. That alone will be her undoing.
2465,Elon and Trump are among the most dangerous people on Earth. Twitter literally looks like a platform developed by Hitler.
2466,AMERICA TRUMP 2024 !!!
2467,"Just switch the candidate, 3 months before the election bro ( we will totally win ) lol"
2468,Tylor  need to endorse her!!! Now is your time Tylor!!!!!!!!
2469,WSJ is a 🤡 network letting all the 🤡s talk their nonsense.
2470,This election will be a handover to a new generation. It will either be Kamala or JD
2471,Lol this laughing hjyena is a joke
2472,NOPE !!
2473,Its just blue people candidate does not matter 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
2474,"There is war on two fronts, an invasion at our southern border, with the invaders taking the black and hispanic jobs, record high inflation, and unsteady fuel prices.  The abortion issue is the least of the problems the American citizens are facing right now.  She was supposed to be the border czar and look at her job there. She is a terrible canidate for President"
2475,She’s barely even Black <br>Please everyone reading look at and follow the money <br>She has done NOTHING !!<br>From prosecuting to being a Senator she has done nothing !!!
2476,Her voice is a problem
2477,"No she is not stronger.  Just look at what she has done being VP.  She has done nothing.  Absolutely nothing. I don&#39;t believe she can win, but Biden won&#39;t win either."
2478,I find it hard to believe they are would replace one idiot with another. I think they will find a way to find a &quot;fresh face.&quot; Kamala was the FIRST democrat to drop out of the democrat primary. She was seen as an unattractive candidate by her own party.
2479,And the wheels on the yellow bus go flat.
2480,Kamala will verbally and intellectually annihilate Trump.
2481,trump is too old 😂😂😂
2482,she can&#39;t win. worse than hillary surely
2483,I guess you could say that was a significant passage of time…
2484,"If they choose Harris, America will enjoy 4 more years of authoritarian Trump."
2485,so its about race again
2486,"This is going to be VERY INTERRESTING!!!!!!<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23harris2024"">#HARRIS2024</a>"
2487,"Kamala had only ONE job as Biden&#39;s VP, Kamala Harris was the countries Border Czar.<br>Kamala Harris is a joke."
2488,I think you can&#39;t count on the black vote for Kamala. There is more to African American culture than just skin color.
2489,Obama help us....
2490,Harris is not qualified to be a high school principal
2491,"She has the entire machine, plus black and female voting advantage…it’s very much a close race.  It’s going to be nothing but abortion and race baiting for the next four months."
2492,Of Course she&#39; was chosen by Obama in 2020 to be Biden&#39;s vp with the intention of her becoming the first black president so the blacks can make History don&#39;t forget Obama&#39;s &quot;trillion dollars Black <br>Museum he built off the taxpayers money he wants to feel it up with black History and he&#39;s useing the Dem&#39;s party to do it! Another bite out of the Dem&#39;s poison apple 🍎 if you vote for her she&#39;s know different then the lying Democrats that almost got Trump killed accusing him and the Republicans of being a threat to Democracy it doesn&#39;t exist in America!!<br>We are a Constitutional Republic!!<br>Vote Trump and all❤
2493,"So the guy that says he can’t go above 48% says he didn’t get more popular after his conviction and we know that is not true, then the next slide is Trump at 49%…. Sure! 😂"
2494,Unless Sanders joins the race it is Trumps for the taking
2495,Nine years of lies are catch-up to them. Praise God. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
2496,"Kamala Harris is the worst possible candidate after Biden for Dems. She has no charisma, no popularity, nothing to beat Trump. And Trump can be beaten easily with right candidate, he is also very unpopular."
2497,"I fear for Everyone in the United States. Will Mr. Donald Trump become president. then no one is protected and he will go after everyone who is not, of the same opinion as him will be convicted and put out of the game, this applies to public servants like you citizens. Trump has clearly said that he will go after anyone who opposes him."
2498,Now Taylor Swift endorses President Harris!! 💙🇺🇸
2499,I wish Kamala the very best of luck....................
2500,Trump 2024
2501,These pundits are joking! They must have been paid or promised something of value.
2502,Joe Biden made the ultimate sacrifice for our country and our Democracy
2503,"All you have to do is look at the border debacle and see if she would be the worst person to be president of the United States. We’re the laughing stock of the world now, we will be a cackling stock if she becomes president."
2504,"I’m with Harris! She’s strong, intelligent, and tough! VOTE BLUE! 🇺🇸❤️"
2505,Biden. Smh.
2506,swear WSJ already had the video made waiting for Biden to rage quit
2507,Harris is going to win
2508,She has my vote.
2509,I support Kamala! A strong woman that rose to the top on her back...🦦🦦
2510,Hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaha
2511,She’s barely even Black <br>Please everyone reading look at and follow the money <br>She has done NOTHING !!<br>From prosecuting to being a Senator she has done nothing !!!
2512,harris  has a worse record than china joe biden who never came close to winning the 2020 election.  80 million Americans voted for President TRUMP to a second term as president . The Democrat communists party inaugurated biden .
2513,Trump doesn&#39;t have policy on abortions. He wants the states to individually vote.
2514,Dead last as a presidential candidate.  What a joke but the democrats did this to themselves be putting her and joe as the talking heads for the folks running the country.  Worthless.  Trump 2024!!!
2515,She dropped out of the 2020 primaries with 1% of joe&#39;s 81million supporters. She&#39;s cooked and HRC is going to shove her right out of the way and ultimately lose to Trump.
2516,Harris is a more incompetent Hillary Clinton. This is actually hilarious.
2517,Fjb.  Corrupt briben gone.  Cackling chicken???  What a joke
2518,"i  am heart  broken  about President Biden,  but will  vote  Harris  a  good person"
2519,Ummm voters top concerns are also the border and uncontrolled immigration. And she was supposed to be the “border czar” and she hasn’t even been to the border! Total failure.
2520,She is 59.  Trump completely outflanked the Democrats with the 39-year-old JD Vance.
2521,But even the doctors have been telling us how st*pid we are for thinking he has cognitive decline in front of us on video for years...
2522,🤣
2523,She’s not black American I am. Shes a Indian Jamaican American lol
2524,Awesome 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
2525,This is gonna be another Trump vs Hillary
2526,Harris will not win because she doesn&#39;t make sense when she talks.
2527,Listen I don’t think Harris is strong enough to win the election. But she is stronger then Biden.. so Biden needs to stop being racist and resign. Let Harris become the first black female president. And she will also have 4 months to show what she can do. She may surprise everyone and step up. But Biden is putting Hunter ahead of her and our country.
2528,"Her party will Not back her and when they leave her in the dust she will sing like a songbird! Chances are the Liberal party will force the Michael to tun, he has no choice! Ashley Biden proclaimed that Joe Died in 2019! They have been using at least 3 Joes for years! You&#39;ve been played!"
2529,"As person of color, I will not vote for Harris! 😂 Because I saw what she have done in California that causes high incidents of robberies."
2530,lessssgo KAMALA!!!
2531,"Unburden by the past, unburden by the past, unburdened by the past, unburdened by the past…she is an empty suit…"
2532,"I am all for Biden&#39;s decision to step aside, he did the right thing.  Biden was feeble, let&#39;s be real about it, now they have a vibrant 59 year old black woman, totally different energy.  It is going to be fun folks!"
2533,"All of y&#39;all fools, this is not a court case, it&#39;s an election. Donald Trump will mop the floor with her Trump 2024."
2534,She is not Black. Please stop.
2535,The pandering to black people is embarrassing 😳 🤦🏾‍♀️
2536,No one is fit to run for anything!
2537,God bless us she doesn’t know what she is doing
2538,"So now we&#39;ll have an open convention because we are not voting for Harris. I hate Trump but she doesn&#39;t have any record to stand on, she was just there to check boxes for voters. I would like to see AOC and Raskin run!"
2539,Kamala is exact reflection of the radical LEFT.
2540,They put her in so Trump can win.
2541,"Fight for freedom, then she will take it away"
2542,Thank you for your service!!
2543,She&#39;s not Back she&#39;s Indian from India don&#39;t be fooled 😢😢😢
2544,"&quot;Kamala Harris will be a stronger candidate!!!&quot; <br><br>Meanwhile, reality waiting to speak:"
2545,Can&#39;t stop change
2546,She is.a mix of Jamaican and half indian...where do you guys come up With African?????
2547,This was made 6 months ago 😂😂😂 you can tell
2548,Young and of hispanic decent. She for sure doesn’t have my vote.
2549,"Why does everyone keep saying she&#39;s african american? Her father is from Jamaica, and her mom is Indian.<br><br>Edit: African American isn&#39;t a shorthand for black. It means of African descent but born in America or naturalized as a U.S citizen. If you&#39;re from Africa and move to the United States, you&#39;re African-American. If your parents are from Africa and they move to the United States and you are born here: you are African-American. It doesn&#39;t just mean &#39;black&#39;. George Carlin explains this better than I can: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8KXYq1a5uw"">https://youtu.be/z8KXYq1a5uw?si=M3K_SZl3_QuJvT8P</a>"
2550,"Harris must be feeling special…… China, Russia, N Korea, Iran want her to win as well!"
2551,"Heels up Harris is like putting a Word Salad Master up against an actual leader.  She&#39;s demonstrated pettiness, an inability speak coherently, run an office staff, or accomplish even the simplest tasks handed her by Grifty Joe. Her only talent was in being so inept, so revolting, so incompetent that not even the most partisan politicians would want to remove Corrupt Joe and put her in his place."
2552,She still may not get the nomination.
2553,"She will mop the floor with him. Better not support Zionism, though. Regardless of husband."
2554,she will sell out the voters just like Obama
2555,Nooooo sir she watched Joe almost take us out and now she would be the best candidate she is apart of the down fall for USA she should be ashamed of herself but the worst part of it is she is not ashamed PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE
2556,No way dems have lost it!! Trump2024
2557,Harris/Raskin ticket - we hope.
2558,Man vs Woman....so it has come down to this...how interesting 🤔 😊
2559,Her party will pick someone else
2560,This woman couldn’t even fix the border.. they might as well hand the country over to Trump
2561,WSJ does comedy too!   Fantastic
2562,I see Harris lies as much as Joe!
2563,"Laughing Kamala will start a war against Trump voters. As far as running the country, she will be told what to do by the real president--Obama."
2564,Harris 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 The cackler 🤦🏻‍♀️
2565,"So. An old guy gets up on an outdoor stage to speak to a crowd and is winged on his ear by a bullet by someone that doesn&#39;t like him. He&#39;s put in a car and driven away. He is thereafter declared a hero by his followers. The very same old guy declares that a Navy pilot shot down over enemy territory, captured, imprisoned and tortured for over 5 years is a loser. Makes you wonder."
2566,Stronger? What&#39;s stronger than zero? 1%
2567,she is terrible
2568,She was the 1st to get kicked in the 2020 democratic candidate nomination.
2569,Well she might be able to negotiate stairs. Might
2570,She has that winning smile!!!
2571,She will be worse to against DT.  It&#39;s so sad that Democratic doesn&#39;t have any one better.
2572,Kamala Harris is not African America. Her mother is Indian and her father is Jamaican American.
2573,"Dems should have had an open convention, but once again - the donors wanted to lead a coup and decide who runs and who doesnt"
2574,India-American not African-American
2575,This is very insulting to anyone’s intelligence and is a clear sign of ignorance on the part of the ones forcing the posting of this information of course there was no bias intended by the posting for sure.
2576,😂😂😂 She was one of the first to drop out and was immensely unpopular when she ran for the Democratic nominee.
2577,nobody likes kamala 😂
2578,Stronger? Y’all funny
2579,Reporter calling her &quot;an African American&quot; woman lol
2580,I dont think she can beat Trump.  She doesnt come across as sharp and strong.  She might be sharp but doesnt come across that way.   I think she mainly got the VP job bc she is a black female.   Pete Buttigieg is SO sharp.  He handles interviews so masterfully and can keep so much info in his brain.  I would love for him to be president but I dont know if the country is ready for a gay president.  I hope so.  He could slaughter Trump in debates.
2581,It’s so funny how the fake news has so many people thinking that Trump said he is going to be a dictator. Why in the world would he say that ? Oh wait he didn’t . Some of you think Harris is going to be a better choice than Trump is laughable. She’s gonna be 100 times worse than Biden but hey go ahead and cut off your nose to spite your face .. they don’t care about we the people they care about power and money. At least Trump cares enough about our country to keep us safe and out of war . And not to mention keeping our economy in check. But yea go ahead and vote blue so we can have another but worse disaster than the last four years.. SMH
2582,Is she riding in or the horse riding her
2583,biggest flip-flop candidate of my life.
2584,No chance in a million years 😂😂😂
2585,"lol.cmon people. ,our cackling border czar will get smashed by russia and china.we are doomed."
2586,Who 🤣 📉
2587,🤣
2588,Trump &quot;I am the leader of the Free World!&quot; . God help us all
2589,She is worst then Biden
2590,Can anyone remember how she deal with crime issue in California before her VP?
2591,"This proves that primaries mean nothing. No one voted for Harris, yet shes your candidate. LOL"
2592,😂 let’s go Trump
2593,A prosecutor vs a convicted felon? She&#39;s got this!
2594,The spin continues.
2595,18 - 29 year olds don’t even pay attention to politics or their rights so good luck Democrats! Trump will win if Kamala is the Republican Nominee because she’s a really bad candidate.
2596,every single comment is anti kamala ......... just take that into consideration
2597,There going with on her back Harris😂😂😂😂
2598,"lol, as a ivy league prof, any gaffe and heinous laugh would be unacceptable"
2599,Kamala will easily beat Trump. The Trump/Vance ticket is the weakest GOP ticket in decades.
2600,Say what you want about Trump but she&#39;s genuinely an awful person.
2601,Kamala couldn&#39;t run a Carl&#39;s Jr let alone a country.
2602,Biden has failed in the WH.  Harris isn&#39;t smart enough and repeatedly embarrasses herself.
2603,We go from Dementia Joe to Brain Dead Kamala.  I can&#39;t wait to see a Trump - Harris debate.
2604,"Donald Trump deserves his time. He has talent. In negotiations, stopping wars in every region."
2605,I think she is on something.  She will only win in a rigged election.
2606,I&#39;m a white male voter. I will support Kamala Harris.
2607,Black America does not support the same lady who jailed thousands of blacks for minor drug offenses.
2608,"She&#39;s not African American, please stop saying that. <br>My vote is with RFK Jr"
2609,Word Salad 🥗
2610,Harris is the best they have?😮 she was not seen for the whole thing.
2611,😂😂😂😂 no one is worried. Democrats say goodnight
2612,Have they told Joe yet?
2613,Will the debate in September go forward?
2614,"Unfortunately, most democrat voters will endorse a potato if it has a &quot;D&quot; in front of it."
2615,"She would be, but... it be a better show if her and Michelle ran against her. It&#39;s absolutely based on experiences and Decision-making under threats or duress. ☕️💀🪽 no reruns"
2616,WOW! That was quick 😅
2617,Whatever nobody wanted kamala harris as president the first time around what make you think kamala can beat trump this time around the only person that can beat trump is himself so good luck
2618,Her whole career happened because she was the mistress of a married man. She was a horrible prosecutor who was forced to let them all go free or be disbarred and more. She only got where she’s at because she’s do anything for money just like Joe and if you really don’t believe either statement THEY HAVE SAID AS MUCH ON CAMERA. In a televised video Joe was on the floor walking around a big group of people telling them a story of how he wanted to get into politics and how other politicians and donors had said come back when you’re older and pass whatever bills we want and we will pay you to do it and help you get in. He then proclaimed that he did. He waited till he got older and would pass any bill and would pass any bill he was paid to pass. HE SAID ALL OF THIS ON LIVE TV IN HIS 40s!
2619,"The unforced errors keep piling up. Next she&#39;ll be quoting Dr Martin Luther King I Have a Dream, and talking about her childhood as a &quot;Black Baptist&quot;. 😂🎉"
2620,Madam President has a nice ring to it
2621,MamaKamala candidate for President???😂😂😂SHE WAS IN TGE BORDER😂😂😂AND YET SHE HASNT BEEN TO EUROPE….and IN THE BORDER 😂😂😂😂
2622,I called this last week. Yall are predictable as f***
2623,I’d rather have Obama back. We aren’t ready for a woke female pronoun president.
2624,Ha. Haha. Hahahah. HAHA 😂😂😂
2625,It will not happen 🤣
2626,Not in any universe anywhere
2627,This just cemented Trump as president for his second term. Now to fix the mess that obiden left
2628,"Trump has a huge problem now because no matter what he says against Kamala, the mainstream media will portray his remarks as misogynistic."
2629,"Women, we can make a difference! Vote blue for our freedom.💙💙💙💙💙💙"
2630,Fight for freedom from you guys thank God Trump’s gonna win
2631,"Kamala Harris is a cackling joke. Literally, the most fake, most absurd excuse for a politician in my lifetime."
2632,Since when is a jamican / Indian an African American ?
2633,Who is she ?
2634,she     said    she    would    kill  him   in  elvertor     is  she    realy   black   ???  she   will  put   obumer   as  vp  then  she  drops   out    or  give    him    all   dutys     ???   it  time   for    rfk
2635,Kamala will get destroyed 😂
2636,"Yeah she&#39;s so prepared to be president that she still wants to legalize marijuana in America, and all you got to do is look at the condition of the border and you know you don&#39;t want her in office in no way shape or form, this is just more Obama trying to hang on to things."
2637,I look forward to the Prez debates with Harris taking on Trump. Prosecutor v salesman. I think she will get more popular with coverage.
2638,If people are stupid <br>After what we been <br>Through for 4 years <br>Then yes they will vote for her.<br>Then you pay for it for 4 more years.<br>NOW  if they look back <br>And see the economy with<br>TRUMP then .....<br>You will go for him.
2639,Harris is a marginally better candidate but doesn’t stand a chance against Trump. So disgusting how this party preaches to save democracy but leaves the choice of candidate to a few kingmakers.
2640,"LOL, LOL....thanks for the good laugh W S J !!!"
2641,"Come on needs to bring up the Trump Epstein connection, and the fact that all of that information that was released has gone quiet because Trump was involved tied at the hip to Jeffrey Epstein. People need to know that. That’s the kind of person that they’re considering for the presidency."
2642,I can&#39;t believe as a register Democrat and this is the best we got!  I don&#39;t know who&#39;s im voting for now.
2643,HARRIS HAS NO CHARACTER.&quot;WORD SALAD&quot;. INDO-JAMACAN.
2644,"Thank you, President Biden.   💙💙💙💙💙"
2645,I can’t wait to see a debate between Kamala and Trump! She’ll word salad and Cackle through every repetitive topic!
2646,😂😂😂
2647,I will vote for Kamala if she is the candidate. I pray she adjusts her personality. I hate her delivery. I hope she does not giggle all the way to the podium.
2648,omg!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2649,I will vote for her after I decide not to vote!!!!
2650,"Everyone has to get off of what she is. She identifies as black. Point is, she&#39;s American."
2651,"Trmp has no say in abortion. SCOTUS affirmed that Abortion is not a Federal issue, but a State issue..... are they that dense they do not realize it ? Sorry, men of all colors will not vote for her."
2652,Harris.....really......what a joke....
2653,Kamala?? Yuck!
2654,I&#39;d never vote for her. Bernie maybe Andy Beshear 100 but NEVER kamala
2655,"WHAT A GULL  <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcIfY57lBJXp6AKBx4CoCA""></a><br>- WITH HER HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER"
2656,I can see the person having a big influence if it&#39;s Governor Newsom from California.  The entire country knows how bad all California is and that Californians were fleeing and droves until he passed a law making them pay to leave the state
2657,"As a liberal Im voting for Harris! Well, as soon as I get my trans surgery!"
2658,She&#39;s a joke
2659,Joe Biden is a better candidate the kamala ever will be
2660,Has been a joke from day one.
2661,She ain&#39;t got a prayer.
2662,If it was humiliating in debate with biden imagine how more it’s going to be with Harris. Get your popcorn ready.
2663,"Kamala won’t be the runner up, I guarantee it."
2664,Dean Phillips please !!!!
2665,is this really the best the democratic party can muster? hahaha!
2666,Women vs men
2667,"Wait, how do yall have this type of footage already? 🤣"
2668,She is not a better candidate to beat Trump😅<br>She&#39;s worse than Biden and that&#39;s saying something!
2669,No way
2670,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
2671,This is a fight between stupidity and someone that can get things done. Kamal is not the one that can get things done
2672,"Not in the least, unfortunately.  After watching her for the last 31/2 years,  hoping for the best, my take is that she is several crayons short of a box!"
2673,This woman will not be voting for her.
2674,How did WSJ have this mini-documentary ready to??😂😂😂
2675,WSJ: Kamala has many advantages<br><br>1. Female<br>2. Not white<br>3. Not dying
2676,She already is polling even or even beating Trump in Nov.  Nikkie Haley republicans were polled after the RNC convention and said they are more likely to vote for a Democrat other than Biden than Trump.  Trump is crapping in his diaper right now.
2677,"Even Hunter Biden would do better in the election than his father, IMO."
2678,💙💙
2679,She lost to Biden in the race to presidency already years ago and nobody cares for her much either
2680,"How much did Kamala pay for this spin, she got so little in the DNC primary that her choice as VP was seen as a balance to Joe being old and white."
2681,Are you high?
2682,"I know they tried to kill DJT a few days ago, but the dems are committing suicide by chooing Harris."
2683,❤ Kamala Harris 2024 🎉

2717,"An administration that puts the interest of illegal immigrants above their own citizens, and the interest of fake men above real women, now wants to be the voice of their own women? What a disgrace to this country and all women"
2718,Only if Michelle Obama was running then there would would be competition 😢

2739,"He hasn’t endorsed her. As of right now, he hasn’t endorsed anyone."
2740,Whoever accepts her request as running mate had better think long and hard.  Being tied to Kamala Harris could be their own personal hill to climb in future
2741,😂😂Lol 😂I
2742,Kamala is hella mean tho
2743,Why would she be stronger she has done nothing so let’s sell the dumb ticket the race card lol good luck. No one can stand DEI Kamala buts the only hope she wouldn’t let big Mike take over
2744,God forbid.
2745,"Kamala has been protected by the media thus far, because Biden is running the country. At the moment I see Harris losing to Trump the same way Gore lost to W."
2746,She&#39;ll beat Trump&#39;s pants off!!

2754,"Harris can’t win against Trump, especially with such a small runway. This only helps ensure Donald Trump wins, which is probably the worst possible thing that can happen. What happened to this country? It’s heartbreaking."

2773,"So to put everything into a nutshell, the only chance she has is pandering"
2774,"You want to scare the republican parties, announce  Michelle Obama running for PRESIDENT, LOL."
2775,"Harris is a weak candidate. Nobody likes her, and her failures at the border are disqualifying by itself. Nobody wants a California elite, especially blue-collar workers in PA, MI, and WI."
2776,"Harris 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Seriously, USA? 😂😂😂😂😂. First Biden now this. 😮😮😮😮😮"
2777,Kamala!!! Good luck . Ain’t gonna happen

2786,HARIS??! Mmmmmmmmmmm.....
2787,Trump2024 ❤❤❤❤

2790,💪🇱🇷❤️U.S A.U.S.A.U.S.A.🇱🇷❤️🇱🇷💪🇱🇷❤️
2791,These fools would rather see our country destroyed than vote for Trump.
2792,Never she can win the election 😇
2793,What has she accomplished?? In charge of the border??….
2794,Why did President Biden endorser her when he said he wouldn&#39;t maybe he thought it was a good idea to get back to the Democrats for what they did to him president Trump will wipe the floor with her I think it&#39;s funny just my opinion
2795,"Kamala fought against body warm cameras on police as a judge, tried to have them ban. Yet apparently is concerned with police brutality…😂<br>Also, how is Trumps view on abortion too strict. He literally said he’d stay out of it and let people vote by State… lies are all the Dems have."
2796,Harris will be the American people&#39;s savior!
2797,"biden is the worst occupant in the white house , and Camila harris has a worse rating than sleepy joe.  It&#39;s fake news that makes a fool of themselves trying to make the Democrat communists party look good ."
2798,SPIN started to make Kamala as the best🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2799,"The installation of KH the DEi hire , she got zero percent of the vote, yet installed anyways, 81 million votes all by mail.  KH is a joke at best"

2801,Kamala Harris place in Prison. 100.000ns Wrongful cases ...
2802,Trump already Won!
2803,"All this nonsensical talk of DNA is a distraction that doesn’t focus on her abilities to do the job! <br>If you’re so caught up and concerned about her ethnicity or race, you’re clearly more tripped up on your own intolerance— NOT her abilities to do the job."
2804,This heels up Kamala should not even be allowed in the White House. This is a circus.
2805,There&#39;s no ways on earth did they just compare Kamala to Obama. Obama is leagues above her.
2806,i wonder when theyre gonna let joe know that hes not running anymore
2807,Please no Harris
2808,"VP Harris and her family  have endured and survived the ugly and threatening attacks of trump&#39;s maga base. <br>She has  perservered against security threats sent against her by trump.<br><br>So, trump can try the martyr card but she has shown tough perserverence and actual courage."
2809,Little Hunter for VP!!! The Harris Biden ticket 💪🏼

2812,Wait so &quot;i&#39;m staying in the race&quot; was another lie? it&#39;s not like they haven&#39;t had a losing candidate before. Their best chance now is running another republican against trump.

2820,We all know why Harris was chosen as VP in the first place….😂
2821,The Democrat convention will have actors and actresses talk and perform. They don&#39;t have REAL honest people . Sad thing is some will fall for this . 😢
2822,😂😂😂😂
2823,My 2024 President. She can win over Trump. Trump doesn&#39;t know enough to be president. He has lied to his votes and now They Regret voting for him this term.

2829,The weakest…. She had the nerve to joke around about smoking weed while she put alot of black and brown people in prison for along time!
2830,I&#39;ll vote for Harris I&#39;ll vote for anyone running against Donald Trump even if it&#39;s a ham sandwich
2831,"she&#39;ll have an earpeice ..or they will take her out maybe ,,,"
2832,"Kamala needs to bring up the Trump Epstein connection, and the fact that all of that information that was released has gone quiet because Trump was involved tied at the hip to Jeffrey Epstein. People need to know that. That’s the kind of person that they’re considering for the presidency."
2833,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<br>Only giggles..<br>From bad to worst.
2834,Trump 2025: will show how incapable his is of making America great. Again.
2835,"The Democrats will win if they choose a former 4-star general who is white running together with a former 4-star general who is black. There is a black 4-star general serving now in the Pentagon.  If Kamala Harris runs for President, SHE WILL LOSE. I voted for Biden, but I will NOT vote for Kamala Harris. I would rather vote for Oprah Winfrey.  Kamala Harris will lose if run.  Also, because of the &quot;culture&quot; of the deep south and Midwest, the presidential runner should be a white male and I think it would be best if it were a former 4-star general or admiral. Because that person would be better prepared to handle current geopolitics than the horribly prepared Mr. T trying to fake being a president again.  We need to think about winning against Mr. Terrible, not trying to force an unpopular female black candidate down our throats. Again, Kamala Harris will lose if she is run and the aftermath will be catastrophic: having Trump sacrifice Taiwan to China, Ukraine to Russian, all of Latin America and Africa to China, etc.  Mr. Trump is a very unwise person and does not seem to have an compassion for anyone. It&#39;s all about himself, not the country, despite his rhetoric to the contrary. We need a white 4-star genearl and a black 4-star general who can immediately know how to fix the military to combat China, Russian, North Korea, etc."
2836,Project 2025 must be stopped no matter what!
2837,Kamala🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

2842,Wait until Biden finds out about this
2843,It will be interesting to see how VP Harris talks to the Black community about her being the first 2nd generation removed slave owner president.
2844,She can win.❤

2896,Democrat slogan +&quot; Do what you can do yesterday today and what today can be done yesterday.&quot; its better than ksjfaljdfalkjfakfj  speach.
2897,I think she will lose
2898,"Oh my, she got bussed!  The struggle of her life.  Everyone else outside America walks miles to school."
2899,"She&#39;s one of those people that keeps talking about women&#39;s choices and wants us to forget that she was a PROSECUTOR that locked up people for marijuana. She&#39;s an AWFUL person and I think we deserve a BETTER candidate. She was Biden&#39;s choice, not ours."
2900,Kamala is not and was not strong in any way. Tulsi ended her. Until the DEI vp scene came along.
2901,she not please saying African Americans she has blood line to Africa
2902,Kamala locked up so many black people for petty crimes.
2903,"Pfft school bus lady? Hyena harris? Is that the best they have? This is going to be great, I cant wait for the Trump / Harris debate. Too little, too late guys."
2904,Kamala was the most despised candidate of her own party. <br><br>The hyena will not be the nominee. <br><br>It will be Killary or Big Mike
2905,"We all already knew Trump won, but this will just secured it. She has deliberately been out of the picture for the past 3 1/2 years. Just too add she hasn’t given anyone a reason why. She has a horrible track record! She’s not a good pic for the Democratic Party!"
2906,"It&#39;s going to be harder, but we&#39;re still confident. She has a lot of baggage and I think she might be a robot."
2907,Newsom/Harris2024!!!! 🔥💙🗳️🌊🔥💙🗳️🌊

2909,Having a verified straight up drunk as a presser would blow a leak.
2910,Can&#39;t believe Biden dropped out uuuggghhhh that attempt did its job in making Biden drop out .... sickening
2911,Black men won’t vote for Kamala over Trump. She still has the same policies as Biden.
2912,She is not African American.She is Jamaican/indian. Huge difference.
2913,😂😂😂 This is truly hilarious...what an interesting time to be alive
2914,SHE&#39;S NOT AFRICAN-AMERICAN!!!!  GET IT RIGHT!!
2915,I’ve never seen her do much more than embarrass our country by laughing inappropriately
2916,Celestial said: Kamala will change as a excellent speaker like never before. She will unite all women of America and she will be your next President. She said this about two years ago.
2917,"This article misses the mark.  Look at her track record, she is not popular amongst many groups.  Polls in the near future will show this.  She PROMPTED VIOLENCE And the RIOTS.  Let’s she what she says after the Assassination attempt."
2918,The border Czar??  Ohhh no thank you<br>Harris is a FAIL
2919,No for kamala i still remember biden gave her the boarder issue and she laughed and did nothing for 4 years! Never once went to the boarder. What has she been doing these past 4 years! Sitting laughing giggling on tv
2920,Maxi Pad Ear Toast!
2921,No. No she’s not.
2922,Get ready for pulling the race card on steroids.
2923,She talking about herself!!! Worst ever!
2924,Harris has nothing to run on. She doesn&#39;t even know how to talk. More violence out of her mouth.
2925,She is not African American woman.
2926,"Biden drops out of presidential race, endorses Harris: <a href=""https://on.wsj.com/4fdXnWg"">https://on.wsj.com/4fdXnWg</a>"

2928,No way she can beat Trump with her record and she can&#39;t speak.
2929,kakala for 🚌
2930,Maxi Pad Ear Toast!
2931,Cackling kamala😂😂😂😂
2932,Trumps restrictions on abortion? The restrictions are state to state not federal
2933,He has dropped out.  LoL. Trump Will Smash Kamala.  Trump is Your Voice and Future President!!!  Get Ready!!!
2934,Bahahahahaha 😅
2935,Trump is to old!!!!!!!
2936,Kamala’s body language the giggle cackle is not the plus factor  -her DEI - qualification <br>Her only card is her dark color .
2937,"What a load of BS, she hasn&#39;t a clue what day it is, let alone win the election, she&#39;s even more unpopular that senile Biden !"
2938,Sounds like the 9 billionth attempt at rehabilitating this woman who’s flopped every time voters have had their say.
2939,2024 President Trump
2940,Fake new media strikes again.  Harris lost Californians and quit. Wake up and smell the coffee. Bring on Newsom 2024.
2941,"IF OUR LORD GOD ALMIGHTY,  DO NOT INTERVENE,  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CONSTITUTION,  FREEDOM,  GOVERNMENT,  FLAG,  HISTORY,  CHILDREN,  IS DOOM."
2942,You guys gotta stop making jokes yall can’t be serious with this right???!!! 😂
2943,"She&#39;s a do nothing, a token candidate if selected at the DNC convention. Liberals for the most part HATE her. Only the die-hard will vote for her."
2944,Of course yes
2945,She has this white girls vote!!! Vote blue!!!!💙💙💙
2946,It&#39;s time to unburden what has been for the past 4 years 😂 No thanks.
2947,Nope!
2948,Just laugh it off and the problem will be solved. She is a joke! Trump vs Harris. Get your popcorn ready!
2949,"No, if you look at her record in CA and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&amp;t=46"">0:46</a> as. VP. We do not need a DEI president !"
2950,Soooo...no?
2951,Have they forgotten that the democrats don&#39;t like her???
2952,😂😂😂😂😂 Kamala stronger against Trump? Well she is unburdened by what has been😂😂😂
2953,Its too little too late not saying she couldn&#39;t do it but not this late and with this amount of disorganization and unprofessionalism in their party.
2954,we are unburdened   by what was has been.... we are unburdened   by what was has been... we are unburdened   by what was has been.... we are unburdened   by what was has been. ...
2955,"I’m done watching Wall Street Journal 😂 if you pay attention to any poles, you know that she’s gonna lose RFK is our only hope"
2956,She is not African American
2957,HAHAHA it’s over! TRUMP WILL BE #47
2958,"Kamala had one job to secure the border and she failed, now she&#39;s running for President???🤪"
2959,It was a total set up not an assassination
2960,"Ever since Jan 6th, 2021 the WSJ has has been deranged and not objective and gone biased-left on climate and against Trump. When you can tell any newspaper&#39;s political slant by the headlines in its &#39;news&#39; section, you know they are violating the canons of objective, neutral journalism. You should not be able to tell which side they are on so easily."
2961,Another henyard just what peopl need...lololol
2962,"If Biden isn’t a useful puppet, try Harris"
2963,"kamala is a joke, how will she explain her complete absence the lst 3.5 yrs and the state of the border. Dems are just hoping for a DEI vote and have picked a loser. there could be a brokered convention in august so this is going to get very nasty! either way she loses."
2964,"Heals up Harris, lol, not presidential."
2965,DNC is going to remove her name from the ticket wait for it.
2966,Biden Harris policy’s are still garbage
2967,Kamala Harris can’t win the Rust belt.
2968,You people are never happy.
2969,&lt;&lt;Hasta la Vista Papi ! &gt;&gt;   The Trumpinator  did the job
2970,Kamala scares me ... she is always laughing and she doesn&#39;t make any sense when she talks
2971,"It&#39;s so over. Kamala is:<br><br>1. A coastal elite lib, not a middle American union labor lib. This has always been the unholy union of Dem populism. She will not play well in the rust belt. Biden was the pull there, not her.<br><br>2. Appealing to Black voters: Kamala again is a coast elite, and was a prosecutor. She locked young black men up for a living."
2972,kackles
2973,"No, no shes not."
2974,WSJ =propaganda media
2975,Kamalah for Commander in Cheif??  Not possible
2976,"I actually think that Harris was a &quot;stronger&quot; candidate in 2020 before the world actually got a chance to witness her incompetence. This DEI hire doesn&#39;t have a snowball chance of beating Trump. No amount of cheating or rigging this upcoming election is going to put her ahead of Trump. You know it, I know it, the entire Universe knows it.<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2024"">#TRUMP2024</a>"
2977,🤣 weeeeee
2978,"WARNING!!! ⚠️ <br>🤨NBC,CBS,ABC,PBS,CNN,FOX is STATE RUN PROPAGANDA MEDIA for the Deep State (Operation Mocking🐦)... if you don&#39;t believe or realize it, that means it&#39;s working."
2979,"I agree. I will vote for Harris, not the old deranged guy."
2980,She has a unique opportunity to get the least number of votes ever.  Has she ever visited the border?  Can&#39;t see that clip enough times.
2981,Kamala was the worst candidate they have against Trump.
2982,"Sadly, too many on this thread are commenting about her race.  Let me help those who too often believe their view is the only one that matters.  If your ancestors, the ones who hung people by trees, saw her, would they embrace her as an individual? Absolutely, not.  <br><br>Too many want to say she&#39;s not African/Black.  Mind you, her father was Jamaican and her mother was Indian.  That equates to Black.  The same way  the Bible speaks of the savior being hidden in Africa, from capture, from King Herod and somehow we get a Blue-eyed European.  Seems that race is only considered when it benefits a select few.  I wonder who?"
2983,I Never have been more ASHAMED OF THIS COUNTRY than I am RIGHT NOW!!! Kumala Harris for President??!!??!!??!!
2984,Kamala Harris is of Sub-Saharan African descent and Indian descent. she is not African-American with roots to slavery in the Americas.
2985,Pick Harris dems so we can make sure Trump gets elected!
2986,How any American of European decent would vote for a party who literally wants to genocide them is unreal.
2987,Hopefully this gives Kennedy more support!!
2988,"&quot;Harris is extremely strong, she went from polling in single digits to 20%&quot;"
2989,&quot;The precedence of the Presidency gains timely significance in the presence of the peasants&quot;. hyuck hyuck hyuck...
2990,From Dumb to Dumber 😂😂
2991,Will not do nothing for  Bottom never America 🇺🇸 USA.  Hate the bottom.
2992,I’m done watching Wall Street Journal
2993,"I WILL VOTE FOR DAVID DUKE BEFORE I VOTE FOR HARRIS AND YEAH, I&#39;M BLACK."
2994,Kamala Harris only got 2% of the votes in the primary when she ran for President!
2995,"They have to keep Kamala on the ticket. I read The $90 million in campaign funds are only available to Biden and Kamala since it was donated to their campaign. If they dump Kamala, the funds are frozen. <br>But wouldn’t the WSJ know that !"
2996,She cant talk no better than biden
2997,I remember tulsi destroyed Kamala with 1 reply. It was a good one for sure.
2998,Lol nobody is gonna vote for her.
2999,Such a joke for the democrats.
3000,You know the democrats are going to be pulling shenanigans counting votes again.
3001,😂  Kamala will lose. The democrats have lied for years about Biden’s mental and physical health. Trump 2024
3002,Now they are going to gaslight us about how great of a candidate Harris is
3003,SHE IS IN CHARGE OF THE BORDER AND HAS BEEN DISASTROUS. IMAGINE WHAT SHE WILL DO TO AN ENTIRE COUNTRY
3004,There to this day are still males whom won&#39;t vote for her because they don&#39;t want a woman in charge or a minority in charge especially as a president... same reason many didn&#39;t vote for Hilary
3005,"oh lord, they are already spinning so hard on the MSM. quote, &quot;now is the time and the time is now and the is and the now.&quot;"
3006,i will kms if harris becomes president
3007,"The last time Trump went up against a woman candidate, we all know what happened….just waiting to see the same thing happen again🤌🏾😉"
3008,Ur gonna loose Trump! Biden would beat Trump in November
3009,I hope they break the news to Biden gently that he dropped out
3010,"&quot;Donald Trump simply does not have the character to be President of the United States,&quot; said Kamala Harris from under Willie Brown&#39;s desk...<br><br>edit: clarified for the critical thinking skills impaired"
3011,what has she done in the past 4 years being the VP to and for us the people? she can not lead our country as many are aware of.
3012,"I m a Democrat  an .shes not the answer.I m sitting here thinking about what she did.4 yrs u should have 10 things u did for the country its really weird, these people get in power an thing doing one thing is a big deal lol."
3013,Now Kam&#39;s going to be fashioned the great Dem hope!<br>Good luck on that.

3017,Harris has my vote. Anyone but 45...
3018,She&#39;s NOT African American.  She&#39;s Indian &amp; Jamecan.
3019,Trump would challenge her on her usefulness
3020,Isn’t Kamala Indian ? I thought Indian is different to African American
3021,"We know from 2016 that white women are going to vote against Kamala🙄, the same way they voted against Hilary"
3022,Where is Michelle.. She needs to show her face  for support.. We have to win Blue
3023,NO
3024,Nobody wanted or liked Harris when she was trying to run last time. Not even her OWN state. Thank you for the easy win.
3025,What did she do for the country within 3&amp;1/2 years? Details pls
3026,what has she ever done
3027,Trump can compete only with women. <br>Hilary Clinton was the main reason for  Trump’s election.
3028,She is not even half African American. She Jamaican.
3029,Vote blue vote Harris now unite around her now to defeat Trump the felon.
3030,"You&#39;re just saying that she is African-American in an effort to attract votes from the black community.<br>You misrepresented her entirely.<br>I&#39;m not a Harris fan by any stretch of the imagination, but for God&#39;s sake, get your basic information correct, WSJ!"
3031,Kamala should ask hillary.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3032,"This video is spinning ABSOLUTE solid bovine nitrogenous waste. Word salad and giggling will win her the election? Sorry. Before Biden stepped down, Kamala polled even WORSE than Joe Biden. How is she going to magically turn her lack of abilities around?"
3033,"She IS NOT an “African American” woman.  And because I am one, it takes more than that to get my vote."
3034,"If Harris is the Democratic nominee, Trump has the Presidency in the bag."
3035,She reminds me of a laughing Hyena 😢😢😢
3036,😂😂😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡. Harris is worse than Biden.
3037,Oh no
3038,"November 5 Trump from New York City,,,,bs"
3039,I am heartbroken about Biden stepping down. I completely support Kamala Harris!
3040,Trump doesn&#39;t have an abortion policy. It&#39;s purely a state issue.
3041,No she isn’t she’s just as bad
3042,First female President of United State..
3043,She got my vote for sure 💪
3044,"Please let it be kamala harris and pete buttigieg ticket. Both already know how to run the administration and it’s the same administration so no drastic changes, both are good debaters/speakers, both tick a lot of boxes for dems and young people. Young, smart, she will be the first black female president and he will be the first gay vice president, both have a diverse knowledge and experiences between them from law, politics, economy to military. She’s a former attorney general/senator, he’s a military veteran/mayor. So many good things about these two. I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed for this to happen."
3045,Now is the refreshing excitement in the 2024 race for the White House that I&#39;ve been waiting for. That&#39;s why I love America. 🫡🇺🇸
3046,"I could vote for biden or trump, but absolutely no way i would vote for kamala harris."

3052,LOL. WSJ... SMH
3053,Kamala sucks no really
3054,Harris will lose faster than Trump. She’s useless.
3055,Republicans win married women.<br>Democrats win single women.<br>Single women keep the Democrats afloat.
3056,That’s a really interesting video and shows a certain intellectual absence Unkown in common hours and destined to have a certain type of impact on a certain type of person most likely. What are the ideas of Joe Biden aside from corruption and profiteering off the backs of those that pay taxes in The United States of America.
3057,She is worse at public speaking than Joe Biden 😂😂😂😂
3058,you guys have this video ready to upload for weeks 😂
3059,Karmela is going to be Trump Depends in November
3060,Stronger candidate than Biden ??<br>Isn&#39;t that kinda saying stronger than a carrot ?
3061,The problem with analyzing an upward chess battle is you must consider that opponent at a disadvantage isnt exactly a genius mastermind
3062,😂😂😂 stronger!
3063,"Her ad &quot;I&#39;m out in these streets to girl&quot;. She&#39;s in the white house....She&#39;s apart of the failed administration. She&#39;ll never win and it has nothing to do with race or sex. Results make a difference. Dems dislike cops, she&#39;s a ex cop."
3064,"Biden, you must be kidding to pick someone worst than you.  You just made sure Trump will win.  I voting for KENNEDY."
3065,Wasn&#39;t she the first to drop out of the primaries?
3066,😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3067,"Why isn&#39;t Biden resigning? If Harris is good enough to be president in six months, why isn&#39;t she good enough to be president now?"
3068,Latest Zogby Poll shows that Trump wins head to head against Harris <br>Trump 51%<br>Harris 49%<br><br>Kennedy 57%<br>Trump 43%<br><br>RFk Jr for President 2024
3069,"I WILL NOT VOTE FOR HARRIS AND YEAH, I&#39;M BLACK."
3070,Maga now starting to get shaky knees.... plenty night mares ahead
3071,Kamala is not qualified to be VP or President.
3072,Kamala Harris is no Barack Obama!
3073,"After the all the bad she did to California, someone has the gall to say she&#39;s a stronger candidate against Trump. Someone is delusional!"
3074,Well it&#39;s America&#39;s last hope of making sure the felon doesn&#39;t keep his promise of being a dictator on day one.

3084,"So somehow, Harris has went from 0 support in the 2020 primaries to head the ticket by default in 2024. Ought to be interesting."
3085,So according to Dems cringe Kamala is an improvement from Joe Biden??😂😂😂

3125,Kamal Harris is not Obama. Not even close.
3126,No....Biden had my vote. I&#39;d rather remove my own tongue with a dull pair of toenail clippers than vote for Kamala Harris for president. I didn&#39;t want her for VP......but tolerated her for Joe&#39;s sake.

3152,I can’t see what Kamaro Harris do for almost 4 years of vice president of United of American
3153,NO! SHE WILL NOT WIN Against Trump
3154,It&#39;s going to be the same stuff ain&#39;t nothing going to change you people better wake up them people study line for you for the last 60 years they didn&#39;t do nothin 60 years they&#39;re not going to do nothing now that&#39;s my comment

3157,lol...WSJ.....what a joke!!!   TRUMP  2024!!!
3158,In what reality
3159,Nobody knows how to prosecute stoners for possession of marijuana for 20 year sentence than Kamala Whois
3160,Kamala a liar and corrupt .
3161,"Prop 47 Kamala Harris. Just run all the video of retail theft in California after the bill she supported went through. We&#39;re trying to reform it now, but 100s of stores closed due to this horrible &quot;Woke&quot; bill. Dems hamstrung by their own woke DEI pick in 2020. LOL"
3162,"The truth,  America will never allow a woman to rule, at least not yet."
3163,😂😂😂😂😂😂🤔🙄😜😝🤣🤣😆😆😆😆 THATS HILARIOUS
3164,What lies she is illegal to be president and has done nothing but giggle and lie during interviews.  She should step down.  A visa means they can deny it the parents  are  or natural born citizens
3165,Nooo clowns
3166,Trump will gain more black and Latino votes this time around especially with the illegal immigration fiasco and more blacks becoming dissatisfied with the Dems
3167,"With Harris at the wheel, America will move from a third world to a fourth world country."
3168,blue 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙
3169,"It’s not a good look for African Americans to just allow politicians to throw anyone in a race and promote them as African American. That’s  a bad look for African Americans, let’s get a candidate that African Americans vote for as a viable candidate to represent them not someone they just say is African American to get votes."
3170,Obviously the Democrats that pushed Biden out think Kamala has a better chance against Trump.  I hope they&#39;re right!
3171,"Ahh, Kamala the laughing hyena 😂😂😂 movie continues, time to get more popcorn"
3172,She is not AfricanAmerican
3173,She stands no chance against Trump.
3174,"Ahhh, Biden would still be the stronger candidate dead or alive from a Kamala Harris!!!"
3175,It&#39;s not exactly that easy. It&#39;s not just about her body. What if the father wants the baby? Then what? How is that fair to the father? There&#39;s a life growing in her body that belongs to the father too? How would we handle a conflict of interest like that?
3176,We want Kennedy.
3177,"You dems are so dillusional, 😂😂💯"
3178,"She has been babling and giggling for a long time, let&#39;s see if she can hold it for 100 days."
3179,"Not likely to be popular, she&#39;s been in the background for 4 years.  Nothing that really helps her stand out.  Corey Brooker would be a Obama 2.0."
3180,You cant even tell the truth about her race....lol...wow...
3181,The Biden&#39;s must have accepted $50 million dollars. There is no way he was going to step down without getting paid and his wife is calling the shots.

3190,"SCAMALA Harris is probably worse than Hillary Clinton, but she has chances of  stealing the election. That should be her campaign slogan: &quot;Steal the election again&quot;"
3191,Hopefully my grandparents and all of my other dead relatives don&#39;t vote for Kamala Harris via mail like last election.<br>😂😂😂😂😂
3192,The only thing that Harris could run against and beat is a rock and even then it would close.

3203,Latest Zogby poll says Kennedy would beat Trump in a landslide head-to-head.
3204,"Whether it&#39;s Mr. Trump or Mrs. Harris. I just hope people can entertain a peaceful, just and rightful election that positively impacts all Americans for the better. God bless! 🙏🏻"

3227,A Weak Administration makes for a weak Country. <br>Im voting Trump in 2024
3228,"I&#39;m not sure how much substance was here. From my point of view, I didn&#39;t hear a lot about her policies or past as a politician/attorney. Seems like this video is just about approval ratings."
3229,Kamala is going down !!!
3230,"She is African American when she is Indian and Jamaican, did I just hear this dude right, I’m Dominican I’m more African than her, by color"

3233,&quot;the knight in shining armor&quot; 🤡
3234,No freaking way!
3235,Research Harris&#39;s Senate record. If you are black you would never vote for her after understanding her record.
3236,Don’t sleep on kamala
3237,"Seriously, dude???"
3238,"Interesting, given elections aren&#39;t real."
3239,Yeah right… it is going to be funny
3240,Buckle up America this is about to be your new president! Things are about to get hairy. Start stocking up on food and water
3241,She can&#39;t win <br>I would love to see her win but not realistic<br>She could be the first American black woman <br>And the first woman <br>To be president it would be a very big factor in today&#39;s politics for it to happen
3242,"Oh how I wish the democrats had a nationally-known politician named Issac Hunt. He would be the perfect running mate for Kamala. I can imagine what the bumper stickers would look like :<br><br>KAMALA HARRIS / ISSAC HUNT<br><br>Kamala has zero chance of defeating Trump. The American public will be reminded that Biden appointed her to be in charge of border policy, and millions of illegal immigrants flooded across our southern border under her watch. She is seen as a clown by foreign leaders after the disastrous press conference in Europe where she answered a serious question by laughing. She has no executive experience at a time when America needs a strong and experienced leader to solve its burgeoning problems that Kamala helped create.<br><br>Perhaps the best chance the dems have, and the one I believe they will decide on, is to nominate Hillary for a rematch against Trump. She won more popular votes than him in 2016, and has the framework of a national campaign staff that she can call on quickly to mobilize. <br><br>The drawbacks to nominating Hillary are significant. Firstly, the fraudulent Steele Dossier that her campaign paid to have written in their attempt to defeat Trump in 2016. It frames her as a dirty politician who cannot be trusted, and that makes a big difference to Independent voters for whom candidate character plays a major role in their voting decisions.<br><br>Secondly, in the eyes of the Black voters the democrat party absolutely needs to win a national election, Kamala deserves the nomination because she is the sitting Vice President. If the dems don&#39;t nominate Harris, there will be a feeling among Black voters that race played a role in the democrat decision, and Black voters who would have voted will stay home.<br><br>So basically the dems are between a rock and a hard place, put there by Biden and his team that tried unsuccessfully to hide his mental decline from the American people. They never should have encouraged him to declare his candidacy for re-election, and when he did, they should have told the American voters just how bad Biden&#39;s cognitive health was. Now the party pays the price for a handful of political staffers who didn&#39;t want to relinquish power and thought they could keep it through lying.<br><br>Perhaps the only chance the dems have is to nominate Michelle Obama. She will keep the Black voters engaged in the campaign, and she can rely on her husband&#39;s network of campaign staff around the country to launch her campaign quickly. But here again, the problem of experience hinders the potential of Mrs. Obama to win. Additionally she will spend most of the campaign trying to defend her husband&#39;s record, which will reduce the amount of time for her to express her ideas for how to solve America&#39;s problems.<br><br>The bottom line at this moment in time is the democrats really have no good options to pursue, but it will be interesting to watch how they confront their problem."
3243,"Harris has never spoke, with intelligence.  <br>&quot;Tardspeak&quot;"
3244,Kamala is just awful.
3245,Waiting in the wings something much much worse and radicalized.
3246,Your first got President Biden out the race now you&#39;re trying to convince us that Kamala Harris is it. She&#39;s not even as popular as Hillary Clinton who lost. You just trying to ensure Trump gets re-elected. And so far the plan is working
3247,"Wait, how did WSJ know Biden was gonna drop. This seems like premeditated propaganda"
3248,A corrupt Vice President May God help us all.
3249,I really think she is Crazy
3250,Now lets  redo that debate. Harris will eat  Trump.

Who took out the enormous short position against Trump media the day before the assianation attempt?<br><br>Do you get it yet?<br><br>The government is doing everything in it&#39;s power to prevent the peaceful transition of government"
3261,Ms. Harris We The People have your BACK!!! 💙⚖️🇺🇸💯🗳️💙
3262,Biden waiting for Trump to be assasinated<br> He knew about it. It did not work...now he quits.
3263,Every decision she&#39;ll make would be a😅 Google search.
3264,She can waste her time talking about the sham trial about Trump and abortion  while Trump talks about helping the real issue which is immigration and the economy.
3265,A lot of money got raised and sent Biden&#39;s way. There&#39;s no way his wife let him step down without money coming their way.
3266,"Trump is gonna trash Kamala with one ear ,"
3267,She cant even keep the border under control
3268,She&#39;s &quot;Not Like Us&quot;

3293,"Her father&#39;s half Irish-Jamaican and half Afro-Jamaican &amp; mother&#39;s South Indian Brahmin.<br><br>So, technically she is 25% black, 25% white &amp; 50 % Indian Descendent. <br><br>So, people shouldn&#39;t really mention her as only African-American"

3396,"Kamala Harris Must win Nevada,Wisconsin,Michigan &amp; Pennsylvania. yes"
3397,Kamala Harris was at 1% in the Democratic Primary when she quit. Please run her.
3398,Hard to say.  America not ready for her yet.
3399,Funny thing is she&#39;s not African American she is Jamaican / Indian.
3400,An Indian American president of the United States
3401,😂😂😂😂 passage of time😅
3402,Harris is a bigger joke than Biden.
3403,"She is funny she got to where she is by being good under the desk. And that is the only thing she has done, And they keep calling her African American ??  Her mother is Indian her Father is Jamaican so where is the African come in."
3404,She wont win either.  The Dems realized they couldn&#39;t hide Biden&#39;s dementia any longer.
3405,"Harris as the Democratic nominee shows you the ridiculousness of what can be, unburdened by what has been."
3406,Trump wins in a landslide. No one has hope against him. Yall are high on copium.
3407,with pete she  is ... there are 14  million gays  ..5 million  are  republican

3422,"Imagine the Harris v Trump debate. I&#39;d feel sorry for Trump, but he deserves no sympathy."
3423,"Cackling Kamala, great. The least liked vp of all time. She was put in charge of the borders.  That turned out great🥹"
3424,We will vote Blue no matter who. The old orange old man needs to drop out.

3429,Heels up Harris? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
3430,I love a good joke..
3431,Heck to the NO!  They can&#39;t have her in spontaneous speeches either.  She&#39;s not going to miraculously become a seasoned articulate speaker.  Attacking Trump is all they got anyway.
3432,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3433,if she wins im selling everything in the market and moving to Germany
3434,Shes lied about joe for 3 years.
3435,RIGHT NOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEEDS AN AUSTRALIAN CITIZEN TO RUN FOR USA PRESIDENT TO WIN. HONESTLY
3436,What can be unburdened by what has been.
3437,"she is divisive, not a unifier. And it is an INSULT to Obama to compare them- his speaking ability is UNREAL and hers is simply not."
3438,Heels up Harris......Never! <br>Trump/Vance 2024 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
3439,Harris could not win a election to be a dog catcher 😂❤
3440,😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
3441,When she loses y&#39;all will make it about race....
3442,Voting 💙 no matter who.
3443,The excitement of Obama is gone....stop with the comparisons.....she laughs and says nothing...she was a great prosecutor....but she cannot lead.....
3444,Stronger? More inept and radical
3445,&quot;Unburdened by what has been...or something like that..heeheeheeahhhhawhawjawheeheeAHHH!! &quot;
3446,Don&#39;t think VP Harris stand a chance.
3447,Absolutely not. I’d vote for Biden before her
3448,❤Biden. Harris
3449,Let the world&#39;s biggest popularity contest commence
3450,She only used sje is Africa American during election time amd acknowledge her her nationality once she became VP. She will continue follow the agenda assign to Biden. Please don&#39;t vote because of skin color. We have experience failure in this presidential Democrats house.
3451,Are you serious?
3452,Never
3453,Joe has promised to get a brain transplant and run again in 2028.
3454,"She has name recognition, is not too old, and is not Trump. <br><br>Being a member of an identity group won’t matter to swing voters. This ‘black’ and ‘woman’ narrative is tiresome and boring. <br><br>Biden did nothing to bring her or any other of a ‘next generation’ along as a ‘bridge to the future.’ Buttigieg and Klobuchar were more qualified but insufficient for the ‘black women’ identity politics engine <br><br>If she runs as though the Biden administration, with its 37% approval rating is perfect in policy, Trump will have an advantage.<br><br>If she can distinguish herself from Biden - gently, to show she has her own thought process and talks straight without all the Democrat prevarication to pander to identify politics, she can win."
3455,She drop out the race because no one like her
3456,Trump 2024. Red wave.
3457,"Its like wall street Journal had this video ready to go , as if it was planned behind the scenes and the democrats and media were lying about Biden the whole time lol WSJ is a fkn joke lol"
3458,Is this SNL?😂😂😂
3459,I would have been happier with Michelle Obama.
3460,"&quot;So, Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So, basically, that’s wrong, and it goes against everything that we stand for.&quot; - Harris"
3461,lol I am democrat and l am not voting for no woman
3462,We didn’t want Kamala in 2020 and we don’t want her in 2024. Democrats have to give us a better candidate. Where is Hilary?
3463,"If the RUSSIAN TROLLS hadn’t done such a good job destroying Biden, this wouldn’t be happening.  Unfortunately, for Russia, they have now put a stronger candidate up against Trump.  Now wait for the Trolls to start into Kamala.  And I see they are already in THIS COMMENTS SECTION."
3464,Trump 2024!

HE IS STILL A VERY SMART MAN... and He is quitting not because of age but rather because he was merely bested by the Russians......"
3470,"Don&#39;t matter who wins Presidential Election, the country will not get any better in my opnion. Lets see if Trumps slogan &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; works."
3471,"&quot;So, Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So, basically, that’s wrong, and it goes against everything that we stand for.&quot; - Kamala Harris"
3472,African American or Indian American??
3473,"At this point,  I will be voting for anyone else..... other than trump."

3479,she had 4% of the vote when she dropped out in 2020. this is the back up plan?
3480,What a dumb move to choose kamala vivek as the next president of the United States shows you how stupid and ignorant that party has become
3481,"&quot;So, Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country.

3485,DEI VP and now they want a DEI P. She has been the biggest no name useless VP in decades.
3486,"If Harris does decide to run, she does not have the numbers to beat trump.   Michele Obama should step up and run with Barack as her VP.   That would destroy trump and the entire gop."
3487,Ok there is just no way you guys had this in the queue. 🤣🤣
3488,Is this a joke?
3489,TRUMPS DONE
3490,What did she do for her country for the last 4 years?
3491,WSJ has become a comic book. Not a chance in the world!
3492,why is the basis of the video: Kamela harris needs to beat trump. Instead of &quot;Kamela Harris has better policies than trump&quot; ?
3493,"Yeah no, Kamala is just as unlikeable as Biden."
3494,❤️🤍💙Kamala Harris-47th President-2025-2032 GAME ON-VOTE BLUE❤️🤍💙
3495,I remember harris was running for president four yrs ago and she dropped out they should&#39;ve picked another candidate trump 2024
3496,She couldn’t even handle the border. How can she debate Trump on anything?  Tulsi gave her the smoke and she couldn’t refute those claims
3497,Ho Harris has worked hand and knee to get where she is.
3498,Democrates sre broken. Trump only.
3499,The only job biden gave her was the border and she succeeded it&#39;s wide open.

3501,"Kamala just Picked <br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23putin"">#Putin</a> as VicePresident"

3510,Kamala is a horrible candidate for president
3511,"Woke America, had a black pres, then a geriatric now trying for a giggling woman what next a one legged Latino."
3512,"She will get the black women vote, i honestly think she will be a turn off for black men though"
3513,I blame the people who voted for Biden!!!<br>And this is really embarrassing for the Democrats!!!
3514,Voting for her is the same thing as voting for Biden again!! Same results so get real! Bought sellout puppets!
3515,"Don&#39;t count out her holiness, HRC. Harris better get fitted for a BPV."
3516,"Funny the democrats say my body my choice when it comes to abortion, but I wasn’t my body my choice when it came to the BS Covid vaccine. 🙄"

3518,"Say NO to Harris,  Michelle Obama,  Hillary Clinton &amp; Gavin Newsom."

3521,How!
3522,The cackling communist has no chance against Trump.
3523,Are you kidding me?????
3524,Not a chance...
3525,"Biden pulled out of the race.  Trump winning the 2024 election, unburdened by what has  been.  Harris is not black, get over it."
3526,Biden did drop out.
3527,Kamala Harris is a drunken comedian
3528,"Cackling Kamala couldn&#39;t even stand against Biden in the state that he&#39;s in, so she certainly can&#39;t stand against Trump."
3529,Bahaha. Kamala Harris is even more unlikable than Biden. The Dems are screwed

3531,Next upcoming debate?? 👀👀
3532,Kamala Harris will have the words to Take Trump down
3533,Never voting dem ever

3547,Trump 2024
3548,A lot stupider
3549,She will be another Obama puppet!
3550,I&#39;m. Still  voting Blue ❤
3551,Harris is going to SMASH Donald Sippy Cup in the next debate and in November.  She&#39;s going to get the female vote and the black vote in the swing states that matter. With Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer on her ticket they&#39;re unstoppable.
3552,No way dude
3553,Biden cant even drop out without screwing it up.😂
3554,Kamala Harris wants to ban constitution and bill of rights
3555,lol.  Ok.
3556,"What Can Be, Unburdened By What Has Been"
3557,Kamala will have Obama as Vp… hum…
3558,Rfk
3559,At least Kamala will be faster and better able for Trump at debate in September and a stronger candidate at this stage.
3560,African American woman?😂
3561,I want a debate
3562,Mayor Pete 2024
3563,ENABLER OF FAILURE..

3579,Harris sucks... figuratively and literally.
3580,"Good luck KH, you’ll need it!!! FJB!"
3581,Both of Kamala&#39;s parents are Indian. Us black Americans are not going to tolerate her campaign pretending to be connected with us . She&#39;s not one of us.
3582,She is a nut. No way she’ll win .:. Good Lord
3583,"Clinton/Harris 24<br>Shes already beat him once and Tmp spent his targeting rhetoric back then. She&#39;s his worst nightmare.<br>Dallas, TX 💙🇺🇲"

3588,Kamala is worse than Biden
3589,The shoes are too big to fit ❤❤❤❤
3590,"Harris is terrible, so is Newsom.  Dem has no one else??"
3591,WSJ has videos for different timelines. Let’s see your video on Lex Luthor’s presidential Campaign.
3592,Harris has as much chance against Trump as she did at fixing the problems at the border.
3593,That headline<br>Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha <br>Thank you

3602,😂😂😂 Trump Lives💯💙🇺🇸💯💙🇺🇸
3603,"Go Kamala, hopefully this country have the moral values to choose the correct option. Trump cannot be allowed to be in the Oval Office again. He is a terrorist and a traitor; he should be in jail! Thank you for your service President Biden. Thank you for putting the country first and thank you for all those years of service. Please, keep enjoying your live and supporting the country!"
3604,Poor man.  I guess he has had enough and sick with Covid made him realise it.  Hopefully Kamala will do as well in election.  Depends on who her VP pick might be.
3605,Yes Harris 2024
3606,She ain&#39;t winning.
3607,Trump will chew kamala Harris if she&#39;s nominated
3608,WSJ is the MKBHD of News 😂
3609,Harris has no chance.
3610,"You can choose her, but a woman wont rule the world, USA is going down as a superpower. Putin triumphs."
3611,Ohh no 🤣
3612,kamala &quot;kicked to the curb&quot; harris
3613,The nowhere to be found VP
3614,I am a democrat..kamala is arrogant amd dry. She will loose to trump. Theybneed ro put somebody else as a democrat candidate
3615,😂😂😂
3616,Good luck!
3617,Trump signaling  &quot; a love of country &quot;  the bone spurs man should visit the Vietnam memorial.  True love of country.
3618,She would be worse
3619,A Femenist
3620,"Kamala has to fight not only the racism in the us but also the rampant sexism, when it was hillary running I remember hearing from many older women that were against her just because she was a woman. This will be one of the most difficult campains in american history, best of luck and godspeed &lt;3"
3621,It&#39;s almost like the Wall street Journal already knew this information and already had this video edited and ready to publish hahahahaha
3622,Pfft.

3640,“We’re out here in these streets.” Kamala
3641,Harris/Buttigieg
3642,You had this waiting. Won&#39;t be surprised if you have another waiting for her vp.
3643,The propaganda of the fake news media has begun 😅😅😅
3644,Kamala has a wretched personality that precedes her politics. This is her main problem.
3645,"WSJ is gassing her up. she has been dormant the entire biden presidency, and when she is in public eye she makes everyone wince."
3646,This just made it official! Trump &amp; Vance did it! MAGA!
3647,It is noted that Joe Biden definitely did not endorse Kamala Harris in his resignation letter.
3648,were the interviewees told to act like as if biden had stepped down and filmed in advance?
3649,Border Czar comeuppance on the horizon…
3650,How scary is it that kamala harris is THIS close to the white house big seat.<br><br>NO. <br><br>Even trump is better.
3651,Not at all. 😂 Lol
3652,This is exactly why you don&#39;t put DEI hires in key positions.
3653,"Love Joe and appreciate everything he&#39;s done for this Country.  But once that &quot;feeble&quot;   image was out there, that was that. And it wasn&#39;t going away.<br>Time for Harris to step up, team up with Whitmer, and put all their focus upon Trump!  Because once Trump starts spewing his BS and makes his first chauvinistic comment...GAME OVER for him!  In addition, now Trump becomes the feeble old man in the race.  Harris/Whitmer 2024!!!"
3654,I am a democrat..kamala is arrogant amd dry. She will loose to trump. Theybneed ro put somebody else as a democrat candidate
3655,t R u m.  P
3656,Yes Yes Yes
3657,Trump
3658,t. R. U. M. P
3659,US election is finish Harris will win by landslide. Poor trump he is having nightmare.
3660,just hand donald the country why dont you
3661,"Well, we know Kamala can never be the first Black woman president—Biden was. 😂😂😂"
3662,Is this the April 1st headline 😆😆
3663,Tr. um p
3664,Harris is 59?!!? She is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! Not just for her age but especially for her age ❤❤❤
3665,Is this Babylon Bee?
3666,"If they actually believe she has a shot of winning after seeing her giving speeches while in office, they are just as delusional as Biden"
3667,"I&#39;ll say this again, the Democrats have a good chance of winning this election if they carefully choose their candidate. Anyone, other than Kamala Harris, will win."
3668,"Well, now Trump will for sure deny the election if he loses. He could never accept defeat from a woman"
3669,when u get harris ur still getting OBAMA
3670,t Ru mP
3671,Didn’t Kamala lock up a lot if black men?
3672,This was LIGHTNING speed 😭
3673,Kamala just ain’t it. She already lost.
3674,We are so back
3675,Funny how shes married to a white guy
3676,"A tactic of dividing the country by gender, colour and wealth is not going to work in an election between two candidates. I think the democrats need to find few other options"
3677,They just compared Kamala to Obama 🤡
3678,hope Trump will take Kamala to the Cleaners
3679,"I am just thinking how long did they made it? Like, how eager were they to hit the post button?😂<br><br>Anyway, i think a primary would be a good idea though. Just saying."
3680,The reason trump is popular is because he&#39;s the peoples choice not the party! If demoracts can learn then it should be given to JFK junior or anyone elected democratically.
3681,Folks are acting surprised the WSJ was ready for this? It&#39;s been obvious for weeks that Biden was doomed.
3682,"The democrats just locked in my vote for Trump. Biden was bad, but the Kamala Monster and her clown like responses to real questions is definitely NOT getting my vote. I was literally saying “Anyone but Kamala” way back in 2019."
3683,"Ecclesiastes 7:6<br>For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, So is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity."
3684,Trump is a terrible candidate for Republicans. Anyone except Biden last debate would have ripped Donnie a new one.
3685,Bernie can win. Bring back Bernie!
3686,The Democrats will now lose big time this November.
3687,Harris is no Obama WSJ. Isn’t she known for putting thousands of men with minor marijuana possession (many of them Black) in jail? Obama didn’t do that. She isn’t as smart or professional as he was.
3688,I am still not convinced that Trump is safe yet - the probability of another attempt on his life is very high - the Devils&#39; worshipers don&#39;t want him as future President
3689,"Kamala Harris is the type of person that everybody is happy to see, leaving the room 😂"
3690,She&#39;s so bad not even woke people will vote for her.
3691,Harris no winning bet
3692,shes an indian her ancestors fought custer
3693,The case has been dropped because the Supreme Court saw how corrupt the trial was. She has nothing against him
3694,"Yeah, but nobody likes Kamala 😒"
3695,She will be the sacrificial lamb
3696,Wow. Democrats Make America Trump Again.
3697,Tulsi knee capped Harris in the debates lol
3698,Her “don’t come” speech really made me think twice about her
3699,If she runs she’s definitely gonna appoint a white man as VP because of the world we live in. No doubt
3700,"Biden&#39;s major weakness was Kamala Harris. The worst case scenario is Biden passing away in office, and Kamala taking over as President. It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous that they are planning to put her directly up as a presidential candidate."
3701,😅It doesn&#39;t matter who it is Trump doesn&#39;t stand a chance
3702,Possible 1st US Woman president!

3723,✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊.
3724,Nope
3725,Vote for Pedro.
3726,I’m good with Kamala. She’s coherent and smart af
3727,"Yooo, who likes Harris? Is this a joke?"
3728,"Nicky Haley was right. ... I expect a Harris campaign to carry Biden&#39;s torch play the Abortion card, the J-6 card, the SCOTUS card, and Wacistism/DEI card."
3729,first ever HR lady president🔥🔥
3730,A black/brown woman? Never. Trump team 💪🏼🇺🇲
3731,"We are with the Democrats , we must stop the nuts of Trump."
3732,😂yes laughing Kamala <br>And somehow they’ll say she’s got the backing and will win🤷🏾‍♂️<br><br>Oh please let’s the circus continue
3733,Weaker 🤮
3734,"Biden, Chump; there is a Third Way – Kamala Harris (www.thethirdwaybook.com) available on Amazon"
3735,"here is an unfortunate reality about the United States, and in particular the swing states: millions of Americans who would have voted for Biden will NOT vote for Kamala Harris because she&#39;s a woman of color. let alone, she&#39;s a VP with a lot of bad baggage."
3736,lol Kamala Harris couldn’t run a WalMart nevermind the USA
3737,"I just have one question, what she has done for the last 3.5years?"
3738,Harris has my support
3739,wishful and delusional thinking
3740,clowns 😂
3741,Kamala Harris for POTUS &amp; Michelle Obama for VP 💙
3742,WSJ had this video ready. The corrupt media and propaganda machine is working really hard to support the deep state. The American people want Trump!
3743,She is incompetent
3744,You knew about this didn’t you
3745,"If Kamala chooses a latino as VP, it will be a landslide."
3746,"Wow. You people waste no time in turning on each other. So much for the compassionate, righteous liberals. Just last month, Joe Biden was your savior. Now, Kamala Harris is better. You&#39;re no better than the GOP."
3747,SHE IS NOT WINNING 😂
3748,We don&#39;t need a female or black president. We don&#39;t need a male or white president. We need a president who:<br><br>1. Secures our border.<br>2. Ends these wars<br>3. Brings down inflation<br><br>We need TRUMP!
3749,I dont like Trump but I would not vote for Kamala Harris.
3750,"She is way more divisive.  She was &quot;the border czar&quot; for a border that has been disastrous under her watch.  She claims her biggest issue is abortion, yet that issue is effectively dead as a federal issue unless the Dems have a super-majority (which they had under Obama and still didn&#39;t act).  She was born without an ounce of charisma.  She was quite literally announced as a DEI hire by Biden himself.  It would be a disaster for our party to run with her as their presidential candidate."
3751,Harris is good.. She is bright but someone else might do better as they need to oust Trump.
3752,Im not a democrat or republican but its obvious Trump is gonna win
3753,"Whatever happens, now media, focus on how TRUMP is unfit for office."

3761,"Unfortunately, Trump is going to be the next president."
3762,Newsom 2024!!!!
3763,Interesting Presidential race.
3764,"omg, it&#39;s need to be really hard for democrats now, if Harris is the best what they have xD"
3765,Bertrand Russell: &quot;The fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid are sure of themselves while the intelligent are full of doubt.&quot;  On all sides US politics seems to be run by people entirely blind and over-confident in their own abilities.
3766,"WOW! I want to know what OBAMA, CLINTON, and PELOSI said to BIDEN."
3767,If u truly hate America vote Harris. Her dad&#39;s from Jamaica her mom&#39;s from India. Both not born in USA that bothers me . Plus she&#39;s not fit to run the world&#39;s strongest nation . There will be more wars around the world fast if she wins
3768,Here comes the corporate media full court press to sell Camela on us
3769,She will not close the border she will just go down to Mexico and give the drug cartels billions for millions of immigrants
3770,US is lost with her
3771,let&#39;s ask willie brown

3775,They couldn&#39;t lie about Biden any more. They can lie about Harris for a while.
3776,Kamala will do just as bad as Biden
3777,"As a 67 Year old African American male Grassroots Republican And a President Donald Trump, United States Supreme Court Justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, The Government of President Netanyahu of Israel supporter who lives at 523 Cherry Street Apt. 605 in the Dempsey Apartments Macon Bibb County Georgia 31201, I will continue to keep President Donald Trump, United States Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, the Government of President Netanyahu of Israel, Our Grande Ole Republican Party and Our Nation at Large The United States of America in my Daily Morning and Evening Prayers taken from my 1789 Book of Common Prayers of The Protestant Episcopal Church of The United States of America and The 1611 Authorized King James English Bible. God Bless the United States of America and the Government of President Netanyahu of Israel."
3778,Madam President
3779,Cope
3780,They couldn&#39;t lie about Biden any more. They can lie about Harris for a while.
3781,Multicultural. Unified. These words do not mix.
3782,Comparing her to an under Obama is just…mind numbingly daft
3783,Harris will stomp Donald
3784,Go @Kamala 👍🏽
3785,These interviewees are delusional. They sound dead inside realising they have no candidate to stop Trump. Pathetic video.
3786,"Harris should not be dupped to think she can beat Trump, the division in America at the moment won&#39;t favor her."
3787,Can&#39;t wait for the roast battle Trump - Harris<br>US Entertainment for the world<br>Thanks USA

3791,"Huge journal like wall street use bot to boost view, comment ?? Wow what ?? 😮😮"
3792,I believe Harris is a terrific choice
3793,"Lets be real, she just doesnt connect with the voters like Obama did or Trump does"
3794,"The trust for democrats is just dwindling, I wanna root against Trump but if that means voting for Kamala or Biden Idk if can do that. Bring someone stronger, I&#39;d have loved to vote for vivek ramaswamy but well he ain&#39;t in the blue corner, lack of strong leaders with Democrats."
3795,Robert F Kennedy Jr is your guy now America 🇺🇸
3796,things are not looking good
3797,Ask Hillary she knows best. /cough /cough...defeated
3798,In order from strongest to weakest against trump: 1) a potato 2) Biden 3) Harris. You’re insane.
3799,Imagine how many videos WSJ creates for timelines that never happen
3800,"You can&#39;t even tell the truth about  one thing,  she&#39;s not an African American  woman, she&#39;s  Indian!"
3801,You might as well just hand Trump the presidency at this point . . . It&#39;s a wrap
3802,Need Michelle Obama
3803,Quit the fake news BS. She is not African-American. She’s half Indian and half Jamaican.
3804,"To be honest, my stomach immediately went into cringe mode when I heard her voice in this video here.  I heard this response to her voice from others too."
3805,No way
3806,20 years younger and can form sentences.  Has my vote.

3815,"LET&#39;S GET IT, KAMALA. LET&#39;S GET IT!"
3816,I think Michelle Obama too. but in all case MAGA still the best❤
3817,Trump  will beat Kamela Harris  like a 🥁 he will win in a land slide
3818,WSJ must have a dozen different scenarios just waiting for it to happen in reality.
3819,HYENA HARRIS IS THE BEST THEY HAVE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3820,Kamala is Americas mamala
3821,Moment for him to spend time with his family members
3822,Kamala is only slightly stronger a candidate than Joe. It will be another Clinton situation.
3823,What does you’re pregame vault look like?

3825,Why this was so fast 💀
